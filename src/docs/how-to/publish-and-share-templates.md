title: Publish and Share Templates

Once you create a template, you have the option to publish it. Publishing a template will add it to our <a href="https://railway.app/templates" target="_blank">template marketplace</a> for other users to deploy.

## Publishing a Template

After you create your template, simply click the publish button and fill out the form to publish your template.

You can always publish your template by going to the <a href="https://railway.app/account/templates" target="_blank">Templates page in Account Settings</a> and choose `Publish` next to the template you'd like to publish.

## Sharing your Templates

After you create your template, you may want to share your work with the public and let others clone your project.

### Deploy on Railway Button

Upon template creation, you are provided with the Template URL where your template can be found and deployed.  

To complement your template, we also provide a `Deploy on Railway` button which you can include in your README or embed it into a website.

The button is located at [https://railway.app/button.svg](https://railway.app/button.svg).

For examples and more information about the button, head over to our [Deploy On Railway Button](/deploy/deploy-on-railway-button) page.

## Kickback program

If your published template is deployed into other users' projects, you are immediately eligible for a 25% kickback, in the form of Railway credits.  Refer to the [template reference page](/reference/templates#kickback-program) for more information.
