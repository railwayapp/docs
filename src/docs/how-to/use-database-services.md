Railway's platform primitives are built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to build any type of service your system requires, including database services.

We have created this guide to help you find the features you may need to build a database service -

### One-click Database Templates

Railway provides four, one-click templates that provision some of the most popular databases out there, which deploy with a helpful [Database View](/how-to/use-the-database-view).  

Explore the guides in this section for information on how to use these templates: 
- [PostgreSQL](/how-to/postgresql)
- [MySQL](/how-to/mysql)
- [MongoDB](/how-to/mongodb)
- [Redis](/how-to/redis)
