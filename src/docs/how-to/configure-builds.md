Railway uses [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) to build and deploy your code with
zero configuration.  You can find a complete list of languages we support out of the box [here](/reference/builds#supported-languages).

For information on how to control the default build behavior, explore the guides in this section:

- [Build Controls](/how-to/build-controls)
