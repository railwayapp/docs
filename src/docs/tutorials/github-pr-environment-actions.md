title: GitHub PR Environment Actions
description: Learn how to use the CLI in a GitHub Action to create environments for PRs
---

[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) come with a pretty neat set of features to automate your workflows. In this post, we talk about using Github Actions alongside the [Railway CLI](https://github.com/railwayapp/cli) to create specific environments for any PR that is created, alongside closing it whenever it is closed/merged.

This can be useful if you need to create a branch on a [Neon](https://neon.tech) database, allowing you to automatically inject the correct database url.

## The Action

Make a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/railway-pr-envs.yml` and add the following -

```yaml
# NOTE
# if you have 2fa on your account, the pr close part of the action will hang (due to 2fa not being supported non-interactively)

name: Manage PR environments (Railway)

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]

env:
    RAILWAY_API_TOKEN: "" # get this in account settings (make sure this is NOT a project token), and scope it to your account (not a workspace)
    SERVICE_ID: "" # service ID to inject database variable into
    ENV_NAME: "" # the environment variable name to inject (e.g DATABASE_URL)
    ENV_VALUE: "" # the value to inject
    DUPLICATE_FROM_ID: "" # railway environment to duplicate from
    LINK_PROJECT_ID: "" # project ID
    # TEAM_ID: "" if you are linking to a project in team, uncomment this

jobs:
    pr_opened:
        if: github.event.action == 'opened'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container: ghcr.io/railwayapp/cli:latest
        steps:
        - name: Link to project
          run: railway link --project ${{ env.LINK_PROJECT_ID }} --environment ${{ env.DUPLICATE_FROM_ID }} # --team ${{ env.TEAM_ID }} # uncomment this if you are linking to a team project  
        - name: Create Railway Environment for PR
          run: railway environment new pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --copy ${{ env.DUPLICATE_FROM_ID }} --service-variable ${{ env.SERVICE_ID }} "${{ env.ENV_NAME }}=${{ env.ENV_VALUE }}"

    pr_closed:
        if: github.event.action == 'closed'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container: ghcr.io/railwayapp/cli:latest
        steps:
        - name: Link to project
          run: railway link --project ${{ env.LINK_PROJECT_ID }} --environment ${{ env.DUPLICATE_FROM_ID }} # --team ${{ env.TEAM_ID }} # uncomment this if you are linking to a team project       
        - name: Delete Railway Environment for PR
          run: railway environment delete pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} || true
```

**Note:** if you are using a team project, you need to ensure that the token specified is scoped to your account, not a workspace.

This can very easily be modified to run commands in order to find variables and values, and can simply be passed as flags to the railway environment create command.
