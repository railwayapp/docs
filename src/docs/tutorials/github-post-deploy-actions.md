title: GitHub Post-Deploy Actions
---

[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) come with a pretty neat set of features to automate your workflows. In this post, we talk about using Github Actions to run post-deploy actions.

At Railway, we've set up Github triggers for automatic deployments when you push to a selected branch, and with Github Actions, you can automate several parts of your development workflow. Recently, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/railway) and [Slack](/reference/support#slack), we've had a couple of users ask us how they'd go about running commands or webhooks after their app is deployed so we thought it'd be a good idea to publish a short tutorial doing just that, with Github Actions.

## The Action

Since Railway makes the deployment status available to Github, we'll be using the `deployment_status` event to trigger our action. This event is triggered when a deployment status changes, and we'll be using the `success` state to trigger our action.

Make a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/post-deploy.yml` and add the following -

```yaml
name: Post-Deployment Actions

on:
  deployment_status:
    states: [success]

jobs:
  post-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
      - name: Debug - Print github.event object
        run: |
          echo "github.event context:"
          echo '${{ toJSON(github.event) }}'
          
      # Only run if this is a production environment deployment that succeeded
      - name: Run post-deploy actions
        if: github.event.deployment.environment == 'production'
        run: |
          echo "Production deployment succeeded"
```

If you have your repository deploying to multiple services, you can modify the `if` condition to check for the service you want to run the command for -

```yaml
if: github.event.deployment.environment == 'production' && github.event.deployment.payload.serviceId == '<service-id>'
```
You can also see what `github.event` contains and build your own conditions from there.

Information on how to find the Service ID and Environment IDs as needed can be found [here](https://docs.railway.com/guides/public-api#resource-ids).

It's that simple! You can now customize the final run step to execute any commands or send webhooks using Curl or other methods of your choice.
