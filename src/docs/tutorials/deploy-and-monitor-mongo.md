title: Deploy and Monitor a Mongo Replica Set
---

## What is a Mongo Replica Set?

>A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set.  Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments.  

Source: [MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/#replication)

## About this Tutorial

In addition to ensuring your data layer is redundant and highly available, monitoring the data layer is key to production readiness.  There are a number of ways to monitor your Mongo replica set in Railway, but this tutorial covers how to do so using popular open source tools, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

**Objectives**

In this tutorial, you will learn how to -
- Deploy a [Mongo Replica Set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/) from a Railway template
- Deploy a Python [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) app that connects to the replica
- Set up monitoring of the replica set with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

**Prerequisites**

To be successful using this tutorial, you should already have - 
- A [Railway API token](/guides/public-api#creating-a-token)
- A Github account connected to Railway
- Latest version of Railway [CLI installed](guides/cli#installing-the-cli)

Most of the source code you will deploy as part of this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/init-mongo-ha).

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a project similar to the one below.

**Let's get started!**

## 1. Deploy the Mongo Replica Set

*This step assumes you have created a [Railway API token](/guides/public-api#creating-a-token).*

First, we will deploy the Mongo replica set using the template in the Railway marketplace.

- <a href="https://railway.app/new/template/gFmvuY" target="_blank">Click here to open the deployment page for the Mongo replica set</a>
- Click `Configure` next to the **init-mongo-ha** service and add your [Railway API token](/guides/public-api#creating-a-token)
- Click `Deploy`

After clicking Deploy, you will be taken to your new project in Railway.

*Note:  The **init-mongo-ha** service is designed to be ephemeral, existing only to initiate the Mongo replica set before it is removed.*

## 2. Deploy the Python FastAPI app

Now we'll deploy a Python FastAPI and connect it to the Mongo replica set.

### Create the app locally

From your local machine -

- Create a folder for your FastAPI app called `fastApi`
- Within the `fastApi` folder, create the following 3 files -
  - **main.py**:
        ```python
        from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
        from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
        import os
        from typing import List, Dict
        import random
        import string

        app = FastAPI()

        print(os.getenv("MONGO_URI"))

        # MongoDB client (motor)
        client = AsyncIOMotorClient(os.getenv("MONGO_URI"))
        db = client[os.getenv("DATABASE_NAME")]
        collection = db[os.getenv("COLLECTION_NAME")]

        def generate_random_string(length=8):
            letters = string.ascii_lowercase
            print("generated random string")
            return ''.join(random.choice(letters) for i in range(length))

        @app.get("/")
        async def set_item():
            random_key = generate_random_string()
            random_value = generate_random_string()
            print("sending to Mongo")
            result = await collection.update_one(
                {"key": random_key}, {"$set": {"value": random_value}}, upsert=True
            )
            print(result)
            if result.upserted_id or result.modified_count:
                return {"status": "success", "key": random_key, "value": random_value}
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to set item")

        @app.get("/get", response_model=List[Dict[str, str]])
        async def get_all_items():
            cursor = collection.find({})
            print("retrieving from Mongo")
            items = await cursor.to_list(length=None)
            for item in items:
                item['_id'] = str(item['_id'])
            return items

        @app.get("/health")
        async def healthcheck():
            print("starting healthcheck, pulling from mongo")
            cursor = collection.aggregate([{'$sample': {'size': 1}}])
            random_doc = await cursor.to_list(length=1)
            
            if random_doc:
                print("healthcheck successful")
                return {"status": "success", "document": random_doc[0]}
            else:
                print("No documents found")
                raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="No documents found in the collection")

        ```
  - **Procfile**:
    ```procfile
    web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-5000}
    ```
  - **requirements.txt**:
    ```plaintext
    fastapi
    uvicorn
    motor
    ```

### Create and Configure an Empty Service in Railway

Now that you have the necessary files to run the Python FastAPI app in Railway, let's deploy it.

In the Railway project that contains your Mongo replica set - 
- Add a New service by clicking `+ New`
- Select `Empty Service`
- Add the following variables to the service
    ```plaintext
    COLLECTION_NAME=mycollection
    DATABASE_NAME=railway
    MONGO_HOSTS=${{mongo1.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017,${{mongo2.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017,${{mongo3.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://${{MONGO_HOSTS}}/?replicaSet=${{REPLICA_SET_NAME}}
    REPLICA_SET_NAME=${{mongo1.REPLICA_SET_NAME}}
    ```
- In the service Settings, rename the service to `fastApi`
- Click `Deploy` to apply and create the empty service
- In the Settings tab, under Networking, click `Generate Domain`

### Deploy from the Railway CLI
*This step assumes you have the latest version of the [Railway CLI](guides/cli#installing-the-cli) installed.*

On your local machine -
- Open your terminal and change directory to the `fastApi` folder
- Link to the Railway project and service by running the following command - 
  ```plaintext
  railway link
  ```
  Follow the prompts selecting the correct project name and environment (click <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/railway/image/upload/v1709917423/docs/tutorials/otel/CleanShot_2024-03-08_at_10.58.55_2x_kacssj.png" target="_blank">here</a> for a reference), and choose the `fastApi` service.

- Deploy the app by running the following command -
  ```plaintext
  railway up -d
  ```

## Checkpoint

Congrats!  You should now have a Mongo replica set and a Python FastAPI app connected to it.  Your project in Railway should look something like this - 

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/railway/image/upload/v1717181350/docs/tutorials/mongo-replica-set/CleanShot_2024-05-31_at_13.48.17_2x_os95j4.png"

## 3. Test Mongo Replication

At this point, you should have a Mongo replica set running in Railway as well as a Python application connected to it.

Let's test the connection to Mongo -
- Open your `fastApi` service settings
- Click on the domain to open the app in your browser
  - The `/` route connects to the Mongo replica set and inserts a single document
- Refresh your browser a few times to add more data to Mongo
- Access the `/get` route to retrieve all of the documents you have just added

Now let's perform some chaos engineering to ensure Mongo replication is working -
- Open the `mongo1` service settings
- Open the three-dot menu on the active deployment and click `Remove` to remove the deployment
- Access the Python app's `/get` route to confirm it continues working

You can also check out the Mongo logs for detection of node failure and leader elections!

## 4. Set up Monitoring of the Replica Set

Finally, let's set up some monitoring so you can keep track of the health of your replica set.

### Add the Mongo Exporter Service

There are various ways you could retrieve metrics data from the Mongo instances, but we'll use the [MongoDB exporter provided by Percona](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/mongodb_exporter).
- Add a New service by clicking `+ New` in your Railway project
- Select `Docker Image` as the Source
- Add 'percona/mongodb_exporter:0.40.0' and hit Enter
- In the service Settings, rename the service to `mongo-exporter`
- In the service Variables, add the following -
    ```plaintext
    MONGO_HOSTS=${{mongo1.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017,${{mongo2.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017,${{mongo3.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017
    REPLICA_SET_NAME=${{ mongo1.REPLICA_SET_NAME }}
    MONGODB_URI_SINGLE=mongodb://${{mongo1.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:27017
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://${{MONGO_HOSTS}}/?replicaSet=${{REPLICA_SET_NAME}}
    PORT=9216
    RAILWAY_BETA_ENABLE_RUNTIME_V2=1
    ```
- In the service Settings, add the following [Start Command](/guides/start-command) -
    ```plaintext
    /mongodb_exporter --log.level="debug" --collect-all
    ```
- Click `Deploy`

This service will connect to the MongoDB and retrieve various metrics.  It makes those metrics available on a `/metrics` route which Prometheus will use to retrieve them.

### Add the Prometheus Service

- Add a New service by clicking `+ New`
- Select `Template` as the Source
- Type Prometheus, and select the Prometheus template (be sure to select [this one](https://railway.app/template/KmJatA))
- Click `Deploy Template` to apply and deploy the service

Now we need to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the exporter.
- In the service Settings, eject from the Upstream Repo by clicking the `Eject` button
- Choose your Github organization
- Click `Eject Service`
- Open the repository that was created for you in Github
- Navigate to the `prometheus.yml` file
- Click the pencil icon to edit in place, and add the following job -
    ```plaintext
    - job_name: 'mongodb'
        static_configs:
        - targets: ['mongo-exporter.railway.internal:9216']
    ```
    *Note: If you find that the exporter is not retrieving data from Mongo as expected, confirm the internal domain in the Service Settings*
- Click `Commit` to commit the changes and redeploy the service in Railway

### Add the Grafana Service

- Add a New service by clicking `+ New`
- Select `Template` as the Source
- Type Grafana, and select the Grafana template
- Configure the required variables to your liking
- Click `Save Config`
- Click `Deploy` to apply and deploy the service

Once Grafana is up and running, let's connect it to Prometheus.
- Access Grafana by clicking on the domain from the service settings
- Login with the credentials you configured in the steps above
    *(If you forgot the credentials, you can access them from the service variables tab).*
- Click on the hamburger menu in the top left-hand corner
- Expand **Connections**
- Click **Data Sources**
- Click **Add Data Source**
- Find and click **Prometheus**
- In the Connection section, add the following **Prometheus server URL** -
  ```plaintext
  http://railway-prometheus.railway.internal:9090
  ```
- Scroll down to the bottom and click `Save & test`

Grafana is now set up to retrieve data from Prometheus!  Let's add a dashboard to visualize the MongoDB data.
- Click on the hamburger menu in the top left-hand corner
- Click **Dashboards**
- Click **Create Dashboard**
- Click **Import Dashboard**
- Copy the [dashboard.json from the template repo](https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/init-mongo-ha/blob/main/grafanaDashboard/dashboard.json)
- Paste the json into the input box and click **Load**
- Select the prometheus data source and click **Import**

Nice!  You should have a dashboard now that looks something like this -

## Conclusion

Congratulations!  You have deployed a Mongo replica set, connected a Python FastAPI, and set up monitoring of the replica set using Prometheus and Grafana.

Hopefully you have learned something new or at least gotten a start on implementing your own application stack with Mongo as your highly available, redundant database.

Note that is a very basic implementation, and you should refer to the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) documentation for information on how to customize your implementation.
