## Certifications

We know that your businesses need to develop strong and lasting relationships with your vendors to build confidence that we can be trusted to deliver your workloads. Part of that is through certifications, audits, and continual refinement of our practices. Railway aims to comply with all for the distributions of workloads and privacy procedures.

### SOC 2

Railway is currently in the process to attain SOC 2 certification. 

We are undergoing this process with our vendor, Drata. After completion, we plan to publish a compliance portal via our vendor. For updates, you can subscribe to the road-map item on [our road-map board](https://railway.canny.io/feature-requests/p/compliance).

### HIPAA BAA

Railway follows a shared responsibility model for HIPAA compliance. Railway will make a best effort to advise your company to set up encryption at rest for your data, to audit storage of keys, set up access control, and storage of sensitive patient data. When a BAA is in effect, the Railway team will no longer be able to directly access your running workloads. BAAs are only available on our Enterprise offerings.

If your company needs a BAA, you can contact our solutions team at [team@railway.app](mailto:team@railway.app).

We are working on operationalized BAAs and continually gathering requirements for health focused workloads for Enterprises. You can subscribe to the road-map item and share your feedback on [our road-map board](https://railway.canny.io/feature-requests/p/compliance).

## Privacy

Railway is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We understand that when working with user code and data, it is important to have a clear understanding of how we handle your data. Railway, on behalf of our users, may remove offending workloads but at no point will a Railway team member modify your application without your expressed permission through a approved communication channel.
