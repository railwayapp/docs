title: Railway vs. VPS Hosting
description: Compare Railway and VPS hosting on infrastructure management, security, monitoring, pricing, and operational overhead for modern applications.
---

At a high level, both Railway and a VPS (Virtual Private Server) can be used to deploy applications. The fundamental difference lies in the level of abstraction and operational overhead you're willing to manage.

VPS hosting providers like [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [DigitalOcean Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets), [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), or [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) give you a virtual machine where you have full control over the operating system, software stack, and configuration. This offers maximum flexibility but requires significant DevOps expertise and ongoing maintenance.

Railway provides a fully managed platform that abstracts away infrastructure complexity while giving you the flexibility of a dedicated environment. You get VPS-level control without the operational burden.

## Infrastructure & Operational Overhead

### VPS Hosting

When you choose VPS hosting, you're essentially becoming your own infrastructure team. This means taking full responsibility for:

**Server Setup & Configuration**

* Installing and configuring the operating system (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)
* Applying security patches and system updates
* Configuring firewalls, SSH access, and user management
* Installing and configuring web servers (Nginx, Apache)
* Setting up reverse proxies and load balancers
* Managing SSL certificates and renewals

**Application Environment Management**

* Installing/managing programming runtimes (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
* Setting up process managers (PM2, systemd, supervisor)
* Configuring environment variables and secrets management
* Managing database installs/configs (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, etc.)
* Setting up caching layers (Redis, Memcached)

**System Administration**

* Monitoring disk space, memory usage, CPU performance
* Managing log rotation and aggregation
* Automated backups and disaster recovery planning
* Applying vulnerability patches
* DNS configuration and domain setup

You’ll need to continuously maintain and update this stack, troubleshoot outages, and scale resources as needed.

## Scalability & Global Distribution

### VPS Hosting

Scaling requires manual setup:

**Vertical Scaling (Up)**

* Manually upgrade to larger instances
* Typically downtime during resizing
* Application restarts required

**Horizontal Scaling (Out)**

* Provision additional VPS instances
* Configure load balancers (HAProxy, Nginx, cloud LB)
* Manage session persistence/sticky sessions
* Database connection pooling/discovery

**Multi-Region Deployment Challenges**

* Manual VPS setup in each region
* Complex DNS/georouting configs
* Data replication/sync complexity
* Cross-region latency
* Higher operational overhead and cost

### Railway

Scaling and distribution are automatic:

**Automatic Vertical Scaling**

* Scale up to plan limits automatically
* No downtime or manual intervention

* Automatic traffic routing to nearest region

**Multi-Region Deployment**

* Deploy globally with one command
![Multi-region deployment](https://res.cloudinary.com/railway/image/upload/v1758247839/docs/multi-region_deployment_h5fxqz.png)
* Auto traffic routing, failover, replication
* CDN integration for static assets
* Simplified data management
* Reduced latency for global users


## Pricing & Cost Optimization

### VPS Hosting

* Fixed monthly pricing by instance size.
* Extra tools (monitoring, backups, scaling) often add hidden costs.

### Railway

Railway follows a usage-based pricing model that depends on how long your service runs and the amount of resources it consumes. You only pay for activce CPU and memory, not for idle time.

```
Active compute time x compute size (memory and CPU)
```

![railway usage-based pricing](https://res.cloudinary.com/railway/image/upload/v1753470546/docs/comparison-docs/railway-usage-based-pricing_efrrjn.png)

Pricing plans start at $5/month. You can check out the [pricing page](https://railway.com/pricing) for more details.

**Cost Optimization**

If you would like to further reduce costs, you can enable the [serverless](/reference/app-sleeping) feature. When a service has no outbound requests for over 10 minutes, it is automatically put to sleep. While asleep, the service incurs no compute charges. It wakes up on the next incoming request, ensuring seamless reactivation without manual effort. This makes it ideal for sporadic or bursty workloads, giving you the flexibility of a full server with the cost efficiency of serverless, with the benefit of only paying when your code is running.
