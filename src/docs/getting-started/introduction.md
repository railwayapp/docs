# Purpose of Getting Started Section

This entire section is a narrative/explanation (https://diataxis.fr/explanation/).  

It should not go into details of HOW to do things, it should simply introduce and explain briefly the foundational concepts.

When the user is ready for HOW and HANDS-ON, they will transition to the next main section which is How-To

## Purpose of this page

This is the first page of the Getting Started section therefore it will be one of the first impressions of Railway.

### What and Why is Railway?

High level of what Railway is and why we exist (mission/vision)

### How does it work?

Info about what happens when you create a service and configure it, etc.  Angelo did an amazing job capturing this in the maturity docs, I think we can dilute that for this section
