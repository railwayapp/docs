Priority Boarding is Railway's **beta program** and is available to all Railway users.

## Enable Priority Boarding

Visit the <a href="https://railway.com/account/feature-flags" target="_blank">Feature Flags page</a> in your account settings and flip the "Priority Boarding" switch to enable it.

Once enabled, any new features we release to Priority Boarding will automatically be enabled for your account.

**Use Priority Boarding with caution if you have production workloads running**, as beta features may have unexpected behavior.

## Keep Us Posted

From this point forward, you'll have Priority Boarding features automatically enabled for your account. We'll notify you of any new features via the [Changelog](https://railway.com/changelog).

We kindly request that you report any issues you encounter on <a href="https://station.railway.com/" target="_blank">Central Station</a>.

That's all there is to it! Thanks for helping improve Railway, and we'll see you in Priority Boarding.
