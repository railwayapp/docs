## Let Percy Know

Once connected to Discord, you'll need to let Percy, the Railway Discord bot, know that you'd like to be a part of priority boarding.

In Discord, open up any channel, enter `/beta`, and follow the prompts.

Alternatively, you can open the command palette using `CMD + K` or `Ctrl + K`, then scroll down to `Utilities`, and select the join Priority Boarding button.

You should now have access to the `#priority-boarding` channel. You should also see that your Account Settings now display a new Priority Boarding status.
