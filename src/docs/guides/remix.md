[Remix](https://remix.run) is a full-stack web framework that empowers you to build fast, elegant, and resilient user experiences by focusing on the interface and working seamlessly with web standards. Your users will enjoy every moment spent with your product.

This guide covers how to deploy a Remix app to Railway in four ways:

1. [One-click deploy from a template](#one-click-deploy-from-a-template).
2. [From a GitHub repository](#deploy-from-a-github-repo).
3. [Using the CLI](#deploy-from-the-cli).
4. [Using a Dockerfile](#use-a-dockerfile).

Now, let's create a Remix app!

## Create a Remix App

**Note:** If you already have a Remix app locally or on GitHub, you can skip this step and go straight to the [Deploy Remix App on Railway](#deploy-the-remix-app-to-railway).

To create a new Remix app, ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) installed on your machine.

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Remix app:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

Follow the prompts by giving a directory name, like `helloworld`, where you want your app to be set up. When asked, select **Yes** to automatically install all the necessary dependencies.

A new Remix app will be provisioned for you in the `helloworld` directory.

### Run the Remix App locally

Start the Vite development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see your app.

## Deploy the Remix App to Railway

Railway offers multiple ways to deploy your Remix app, depending on your setup and preference. 

### One-Click Deploy from a Template

If you’re looking for the fastest way to get started, the one-click deploy option is ideal.

Click the button below to begin:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template/remix)

We highly recommend that [you eject from the template after deployment](/guides/deploy#eject-from-template-repository) to create a copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

**Note:** You can also choose from a <a href="https://railway.com/templates?q=remix" target="_blank">variety of Remix app templates</a> created by the community.

### Deploy from the CLI

1. **Install the Railway CLI**:
    - <a href="/guides/cli#installing-the-cli" target="_blank">Install the CLI</a> and <a href="/guides/cli#authenticating-with-the-cli" target="_blank">authenticate it</a> using your Railway account.
2. **Initialize a Railway Project**:
    - Run the command below in your Vue app directory. 
        ```bash
        railway init
        ```
    - Follow the prompts to name your project.
    - After the project is created, click the provided link to view it in your browser.
3. **Deploy the Application**:
    - Use the command below to deploy your app:
        ```bash
        railway up
        ```
    - This command will scan, compress and upload your app's files to Railway. You’ll see real-time deployment logs in your terminal.
    - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the service is running successfully.
5. **Set Up a Public URL**:
    - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
    - Click [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.

### Deploy from a GitHub Repo

To deploy a Remix app to Railway directly from GitHub, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a New Project on Railway**:
    - Go to <a href="https://railway.com/new" target="_blank">Railway</a> to create a new project.
2. **Deploy from GitHub**: 
    - Select **Deploy from GitHub repo** and choose your repository.
        - If your Railway account isn’t linked to GitHub yet, you’ll be prompted to do so.
3. **Deploy the App**: 
    - Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.
    - Once the deployed, a Railway [service](/guides/services) will be created for your app, but it won’t be publicly accessible by default.
4. **Verify the Deployment**:
    - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the server is running successfully.
5. **Set Up a Public URL**:
    - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
    - Click [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.

### Use a Dockerfile

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the `helloworld` or Remix app's root directory.
2. Add the content below to the `Dockerfile`:
    ```bash
    # Use the Node alpine official image
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/node
    FROM node:lts-alpine

    # Create and change to the app directory.
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the files to the container image
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install packages
    RUN npm ci

    # Copy local code to the container image.
    COPY . ./

    # Build the app.
    RUN npm run build
    
    # Serve the app
    CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
    ```
3. Either deploy via the CLI or from GitHub.

Railway automatically detects the `Dockerfile`, [and uses it to build and deploy the app.](/guides/dockerfiles)

**Note:** Railway supports also <a href="/guides/services#deploying-a-public-docker-image" target="_blank">deployment from public and private Docker images</a>.

This guide covers the main deployment options on Railway. Choose the approach that suits your setup, and start deploying your Remix apps seamlessly!
