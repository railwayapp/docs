title: Build from a Dockerfile
---

We will look for and use a `Dockerfile` at the service's root if it exists.

Railway notifies you when it's using the `Dockerfile` in the build process with the following message in the logs:
```shell
==========================
Using detected Dockerfile!
==========================
```

## Custom Dockerfile Path

By default, we look for a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory.  If you want to use a custom filename or path, you can set a variable defining the path.

In your [service variables](/guides/variables#service-variables), set a variable named `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH` to specify the path to the file.

For example, if your Dockerfile was called `Dockerfile.origin`, you would specify it like this:
```
RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=Dockerfile.origin
```

If your Dockerfile is in another directory, specify it like this:

```
RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=/build/Dockerfile
```

### Use Config as Code

You can also set your custom Dockerfile path using [config as code](/guides/config-as-code).


## Using Variables at Build Time

If you need to use the environment variables that Railway injects at build time, which include [variables that you define](/guides/variables#service-variables) and [Railway-provided variables](/guides/variables#railway-provided-variables), you must specify them in the Dockerfile using the `ARG` command.

For example:
```dockerfile
# Specify the variable you need
ARG RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME
# Use the varible
RUN echo $RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME
```

Be sure to declare your environment variables in the stage they are required in:
```dockerfile
FROM node

ARG RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT
```

## Cache Mounts

Railway supports cache mounts in your Dockerfile in the following format:
```plaintext
--mount=type=cache,id=s/<service id>-<target path>,target=<target path>
```

Replace `<service id>` with the id of the service.

### Target Path

Unsure of what your target path should be?  Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks/tree/main" target="_blank">Nixpacks source code</a>.  Within the providers directory, find the file that aligns with your respective language or runtime, and check for the variable that indicates the CACHE_DIR.

**Example**

As an example, within the <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks/blob/main/src/providers/python.rs#L24" target="_blank">python provider definition</a>, you can see the `PIP_CACHE_DIR` is `/root/.cache/pip`.

So the mount command is specified like this:

```plaintext
--mount=type=cache,id=s/<service id>-/root/cache/pip,target=/root/.cache/pip
```

## Docker Compose

Railway doesn't support docker compose at the moment.
