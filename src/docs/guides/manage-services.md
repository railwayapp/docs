Here are some examples to help you get started managing your services using the Public API.

### Create a New Service With a GitHub Repo

```graphql
mutation serviceCreate {
  serviceCreate(
    input: {
      projectId: "8df3b1d6-2317-4400-b267-56c4a42eed06"
      source: { repo: "railwayapp-templates/django" }
