title: Controlling GitHub Autodeploys

[Services that are linked to a GitHub repo](/guides/services#deploying-from-a-github-repo) automatically deploy when new commits are detected in the connected branch.

## Configure the GitHub branch for deployment triggers

To update the branch that triggers automatic deployments, go to your Service Settings and choose the appropriate trigger branch.

To ensure Railway waits for your GitHub Actions to run successfully before triggering a new deployment, you should enable Check Suites.

#### Requirements

- You must have a GitHub workflow defined in your repository.  
- The GitHub workflow must contain a directive to run on push:

    ```plaintext
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    ```

### Enabling Check Suites

If your workflow satisfies the requirements above, you will see the `Check Suites` flag in service settings.

Toggle this on to ensure Railway waits for your GitHub Actions to run successfully before triggering a new deployment.

When enabled, deployments will be moved to a `WAITING` state while your workflows are running.

If any workflow fails, the deployments will be `SKIPPED`.

When all workflows are successful, deployments will proceed as usual.
