The Railway Redis database template allows you to provision and connect to a Redis database with zero configuration.

## Deploy

Add a Redis database to your project via the `ctrl / cmd + k` menu or by clicking the `+ New` button on the Project Canvas.

You can also deploy it via the [template](https://railway.com/template/redis) from the template marketplace.

#### Deployed Service

Upon deployment, you will have a Redis service running in your project, deployed from the [bitnami/redis](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis) Docker image.

### Connect

Connect to the Redis server from another service in your project by [referencing the environment variables](/guides/variables#referencing-another-services-variable) made available in the Redis service:

- `REDISHOST`
- `REDISUSER`
- `REDISPORT`
- `REDISPASSWORD`
- `REDIS_URL`

#### Connecting Externally

It is possible to connect to Redis externally (from outside of the [project](/develop/projects) in which it is deployed), by using the [TCP Proxy](/deploy/exposing-your-app#tcp-proxying) which is enabled by default.

*Keep in mind that you will be billed for [Network Egress](/reference/pricing/plans#resource-usage-pricing) when using the TCP Proxy.*

### Modify the Deployment

Since the deployed container is pulled from the [bitnami Redis](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis) image in Docker Hub, you can modify the deployment based on the [instructions in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis).

## Backup and Monitoring

Especially for production environments, performing backups and monitoring the health of your data is essential. Consider adding:

- **Backups**: Automate regular backups to ensure data recovery in case of failure. We suggest checking out our native [Backups](/reference/backups) feature.

- **Observability**: Implement monitoring for insights into performance and health of your Redis cluster. You can integrate a Redis exporter for Prometheus, although we do not provide a specific template at this time.

## Additional Resources

While these templates are available for your convenience, they are considered unmanaged, meaning you have total control over their configuration and maintenance.  

We *strongly encourage you* to refer to the source documentation to gain deeper understanding of their functionality and how to use them effectively.  Here are some links to help you get started:
