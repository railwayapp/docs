### Fetch Latest Active Deployment

query deployments {
  deployments(
    first: 1
    input: {
      projectId: "8df3b1d6-2317-4400-b267-56c4a42eed06"
      environmentId: "9fb4baf0-809a-40ec-af32-751f50890802"
      serviceId: "4bd252dc-c4ac-4c2e-a52f-051804292035"
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        staticUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```
