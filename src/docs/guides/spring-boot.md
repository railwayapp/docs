title: Deploy a Spring Boot App
---

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a Java framework designed to simplify the creation of stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications that are easy to run right out of the box.

This guide covers how to deploy a Spring Boot app to Railway in four ways:

1. [One-click deploy from a template](#one-click-deploy-from-a-template).
2. [From a GitHub repository](#deploy-from-a-github-repo).
3. [Using the CLI](#deploy-from-the-cli).
4. [Using a Dockerfile](#use-a-dockerfile).

Now, let's create a Spring Boot app!

## Create a Spring Boot App

**Note:** If you already have a Spring Boot app locally or on GitHub, you can skip this step and go straight to the [Deploy Spring Boot App to Railway](#deploy-the-spring-boot-app-to-railway).

To create a new Spring Boot app, ensure that you have [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed on your machine.

Go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) to initialize a new Spring Boot app. Select the options below to customize and generate your starter app.

- Project: Maven
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: 3.3.4
- Project Metadata:
    - Group: com.railwayguide
    - Artifact: helloworld
    - Name: helloworld
    - Description: Demo project for Railway Guide
    - Package name: com.railwayguide.helloworld
    - Packaging: jar
    - Java: 17
- Dependencies: 
    - Click the **Add Dependencies** button and search for **Spring Web**. Select it.

_Config to initialize our new app_

Now, click on the **Generate** button, download the zipped file and unpack it into a folder on your machine. 

### Modify the Application File

Next, open the app in your IDE and navigate to the `src/main/java/com/railwayguide/helloworld/HelloWorldApplication.java` file.

Replace the content with the code below:

```java
package com.railwayguide.helloworld;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class HelloworldApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(HelloworldApplication.class, args);
	}

	@GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
      return String.format("Hello world from Java Spring Boot!");
    }

}
```

We added a `hello()` method that returns the response: `Hello world from Java Spring Boot!`.

The `@RestController` annotation designates this class as a web controller, while `@GetMapping("/")` maps the `hello()` method to handle requests sent to the root URL, `/`.

### Run the Spring Boot App locally

Next, `cd` into the `helloworld` directory via the terminal and run the following Maven command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Note:** This is a Maven wrapper for Linux and macOS, which uses a bundled version of Maven from **.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar** instead of relying on the system-installed version.

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see your app.

## Deploy the Spring Boot App to Railway

Railway offers multiple ways to deploy your Spring Boot app, depending on your setup and preference. 

### One-Click Deploy from a Template

If you’re looking for the fastest way to get started, the one-click deploy option is ideal. 

Click the button below to begin:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/-NFGrr)

We highly recommend that [you eject from the template after deployment](/guides/deploy#eject-from-template-repository) to create a copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

**Note:** You can also choose from a <a href="https://railway.app/templates?q=spring boot" target="_blank">variety of Spring Boot app templates</a> created by the community.

### Deploy from the CLI

1. **Install the Railway CLI**:
    - <a href="/guides/cli#installing-the-cli" target="_blank">Install the CLI</a> and <a href="/guides/cli#authenticating-with-the-cli" target="_blank">authenticate it</a> using your Railway account.
2. **Initialize a Railway Project**:
    - Run the command below in your Spring Boot app directory. 
        ```bash
        railway init
        ```
    - Follow the prompts to name your project.
    - After the project is created, click the provided link to view it in your browser.
3. **Deploy the Application**:
    - Use the command below to deploy your app:
        ```bash
        railway up
        ```
    - This command will scan, compress and upload your app's files to Railway. You’ll see real-time deployment logs in your terminal.
    - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the service is running successfully.
5. **Set Up a Public URL**:
    - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
    - Click [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.

### Deploy from a GitHub Repo

To deploy a Spring Boot app to Railway directly from GitHub, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a New Project on Railway**:
    - Go to <a href="https://railway.app/new" target="_blank">Railway</a> to create a new project.
2. **Deploy from GitHub**: 
    - Select **Deploy from GitHub repo** and choose your repository.
        - If your Railway account isn’t linked to GitHub yet, you’ll be prompted to do so.
3. **Deploy the App**: 
    - Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.
    - Once the deployed, a Railway [service](/guides/services) will be created for your app, but it won’t be publicly accessible by default.
4. **Verify the Deployment**:
    - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the server is running successfully.

    **Note:** During the deployment process, Railway will automatically [detect that it’s a Java app](https://nixpacks.com/docs/providers/java).
5. **Set Up a Public URL**:
    - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
    - Click [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.

### Use a Dockerfile

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the `helloworld` or Spring Boot app's root directory.
2. Add the content below to the `Dockerfile`:
    ```bash
    # Use the Eclipse temurin alpine official image
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin
    FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine

    # Create and change to the app directory.
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy local code to the container image.
    COPY . ./

    # Build the app.
    RUN ./mvnw -DoutputFile=target/mvn-dependency-list.log -B -DskipTests clean dependency:list install

    # Run the app by dynamically finding the JAR file in the target directory
    CMD ["sh", "-c", "java -jar target/*.jar"]
    ```
4. Either deploy via the CLI or from GitHub.

Railway automatically detects the `Dockerfile`, [and uses it to build and deploy the app.](/guides/dockerfiles)

**Note:** Railway supports also <a href="/guides/services#deploying-a-public-docker-image" target="_blank">deployment from public and private Docker images</a>.

This guide covers the main deployment options on Railway. Choose the approach that suits your setup, and start deploying your Spring Boot apps seamlessly!
