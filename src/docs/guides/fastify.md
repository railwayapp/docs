title: Deploy a Fastify App
---

Fastify is a high-performance, low-overhead web framework for Node.js, designed to deliver an exceptional developer experience.

This guide covers how to deploy a Fastify app on Railway in four ways:

1. [One-click deploy from a template](#one-click-deploy-from-a-template).
2. [From a GitHub repository](#deploy-from-a-github-repo).
3. [Using the CLI](#deploy-from-the-cli).
4. [Using a Dockerfile](#use-a-dockerfile).

## One-Click Deploy From a Template

We highly recommend that [you eject from the template after deployment](/guides/deploy#eject-from-template-repository) to create a copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

**Note:** You can also choose from a <a href="https://railway.com/templates?q=fastify" target="_blank">variety of Fastify app templates</a> created by the community.

## Deploy From a GitHub Repo

To deploy a Fastify app on Railway directly from GitHub, follow the steps below:

1. Fork the basic <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/fastify" target="_blank">fastify GitHub repo</a>.
    - If you already have a GitHub repo you want to deploy, you can skip this step.
2. Create a <a href="https://railway.com/new" target="_blank">New Project.</a>
3. Click **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
4. Select the `fastify` repo or your own GitHub repo.
    - Railway requires a valid GitHub account to be linked. If your Railway account isn't associated with one, you will be prompted to link it.
5. Click **Deploy Now**.

Once the deployment is successful, a Railway [service](/guides/services) will be created for you. By default, this service will not be publicly accessible.

To set up a publicly accessible URL for the service, navigate to the **Networking** section in the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service and click on [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain).

**Note:** Railway requires that Fastify's `.listen` method for the `host` be set to `::`. This allows the app to be available over the <a href="/guides/public-networking" target="_blank">public</a> and <a href="/guides/private-networking" target="_blank">private network</a>.
You can find this in the <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/fastify/blob/main/src/app.ts" target="_blank">sample Fastify GitHub repo</a>. 

If you donâ€™t set it correctly, you may encounter a 502 error page.


## Deploy From the CLI

1. <a href="/guides/cli#installing-the-cli" target="_blank">Install</a> and <a href="/guides/cli#authenticating-with-the-cli" target="_blank">authenticate with the CLI.</a>
2. Clone the forked <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/fastify" target="_blank">fastify GitHub repo</a> and `cd` into the directory.
    - You can skip this step if you already have an app directory or repo on your machine that you want to deploy.
3. Run `railway init` within the app directory to create a new project. 
4. Run `railway up` to deploy.
    - The CLI will now scan, compress and upload our fastify app files to Railway's backend for deployment.

## Use a Dockerfile

1. Clone the forked `fastify` repo and `cd` into the directory.
    - You can skip this step if you already have an app directory or repo on your machine that you want to deploy.
2. Create a `Dockerfile` in the `fastify` or app's root directory.
3. Add the content below to the `Dockerfile`:
    ```bash
    # Use the Node.js 18 alpine official image
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/node
    FROM node:18-alpine

    # Create and change to the app directory.
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy local code to the container image.
    COPY . .

    # Install project dependencies
    RUN npm ci

    # Run the web service on container startup.
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```
4. Either deploy via the CLI or from GitHub.

Railway automatically detects the `Dockerfile`, [and uses it to build and deploy the app.](/guides/dockerfiles)

**Note:** Railway supports also <a href="/guides/services#deploying-a-public-docker-image" target="_blank">deployment from public and private Docker images</a>.
