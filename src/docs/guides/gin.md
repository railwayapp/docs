title: Deploy a Gin App
---

[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com) is a high-performance web framework for Go (Golang) that provides a martini-like API while being significantly faster—up to 40 times—due to its use of `httprouter`. It's designed for developers seeking both speed and productivity.

This guide covers how to deploy a Gin app on Railway in four ways:

1. [One-click deploy from a template](#one-click-deploy-from-a-template).
2. [From a GitHub repository](#deploy-from-a-github-repo).
3. [Using the CLI](#deploy-from-the-cli).
4. [Using a Dockerfile](#use-a-dockerfile).

## One-Click Deploy From a Template

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template/dTvvSf)

We highly recommend that [you eject from the template after deployment](/guides/deploy#eject-from-template-repository) to create a copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

**Note:** You can also choose from a <a href="https://railway.com/templates?q=gin" target="_blank">variety of Gin app templates</a> created by the community.

## Deploy From a GitHub Repo

To deploy a Gin app on Railway directly from GitHub, follow the steps below:

1. Fork the basic <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/gin" target="_blank">Gin GitHub repo</a>. 
    - If you already have a GitHub repo you want to deploy, you can skip this step.
2. Create a <a href="https://railway.com/new" target="_blank">New Project.</a>
3. Click **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
4. Select the `gin` or your own GitHub repo.
    - Railway requires a valid GitHub account to be linked. If your Railway account isn't associated with one, you will be prompted to link it.
5. Click **Deploy Now**.

Once the deployment is successful, a Railway [service](/guides/services) will be created for you. By default, this service will not be publicly accessible.

To set up a publicly accessible URL for the service, navigate to the **Networking** section in the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service and click on [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain).

## Deploy From the CLI

1. <a href="/guides/cli#installing-the-cli" target="_blank">Install</a> and <a href="/guides/cli#authenticating-with-the-cli" target="_blank">authenticate with the CLI.</a>
2. Clone the forked <a href="https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/gin" target="_blank">gin GitHub repo</a> and `cd` into the directory. 
    - You can skip this step if you already have an app directory or repo on your machine that you want to deploy.
3. Run `railway init` within the app directory to create a new project. 
4. Run `railway up` to deploy.
    - The CLI will now scan, compress and upload our gin app files to Railway's backend for deployment.

## Use a Dockerfile

1. Clone the forked `gin` repo and `cd` into the directory.
    - You can skip this step if you already have an app directory or repo on your machine that you want to deploy.
3. Create a `Dockerfile` in the `gin` or app's root directory.
4. Add the content below to the `Dockerfile`:
    ```docker
    # Use the Go 1.23 alpine official image
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/golang
    FROM golang:1.23-alpine

    # Create and change to the app directory.
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy go mod and sum files
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./

    # Copy local code to the container image.
    COPY . ./

    # Install project dependencies
    RUN go mod download

    # Build the app
    RUN go build -o app
   
    # Run the service on container startup.
    ENTRYPOINT ["./app"]
    ```
4. Either deploy via the CLI or from GitHub.

Railway automatically detects the `Dockerfile`, [and uses it to build and deploy the app.](/guides/dockerfiles)

**Note:** Railway supports also <a href="/guides/services#deploying-a-public-docker-image" target="_blank">deployment from public and private Docker images</a>.
