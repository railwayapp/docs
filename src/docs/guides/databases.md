Railway's platform primitives are built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to build any type of service your system requires, including database services.

#### Feature Highlights

|-|-|
| **Essential Features** | Railway has developed some essential features for enabling any type of database service to run in Railway - Volumes for persisting your data, and TCP Proxy for facilitating communication to your database from the internet.                                                                                   |
| **Database Templates** | Not only is our Template Marketplace filled with many different database service templates, but Railway also maintains several templates for some of the most popular databases out there - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis. |

Use the next few pages to understand how to build your own database service or how to use the templates available.

Note that the Railway-provided databases are still considered unmanaged services, meaning you will need to take the appropriate steps to ensure they are optimized for your usecase.
