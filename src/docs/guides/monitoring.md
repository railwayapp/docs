Let's learn about monitoring your services!

At this point, you should be feeling confident in your understanding of the foundational concepts and operations in Railway.

Now is a great time to learn how to dig into your service's logs and metrics, so you can debug issues or track performance between code deploys.  You'll also learn how to enable notifications when your [deployments change state](/reference/deployments#deployment-states).

#### Main Concepts

|-|-|
| **Logs and Metrics** | Logs are the lines sent to `stdout` or `stderr` from your application code.  Metrics represent measured system level performance, like CPU and RAM.  Railway surfaces both logs and metrics for your services.                                                                                     |
| **Notifications** | An essential part of monitoring is through proactive notifications.  Configure a webhook to be notified when any of your deployed services change state. |
