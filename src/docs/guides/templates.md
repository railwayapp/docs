| **Bootstrap Projects** | Templates are the best way to bootstrap a project by enabling you to provision a service or set of services in a matter of clicks.  Choose a template to deploy from the marketplace, or create your own from your personal scaffold.                                                                                   |
| **Community Clout** | When you publish a template, it is placed into our template marketplace for all users of the Railway community to take advantage. |
| [**Kickback Program**](/reference/templates#kickback-program) | Usage incurred by deployed templates from the marketplace are automatically eligible for a 25% kickback of the usage.  In short, get paid for building templates!                                                                                                            |
