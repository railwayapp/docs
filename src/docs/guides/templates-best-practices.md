Creating templates can get complex, but these best practices will help you create templates that are easy to use and maintain.

## Checklist

Depending on the type of template, there are different things to consider:

- [Template and Service Icons](#template-and-service-icons)
- [Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions)
- [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
- [Health Checks](#health-checks)
- [Overview](#overview)

### Template and Service Icons

Template and service icons are important for branding and recognition, they give the template a more professional look and feel.

Always use 1:1 Aspect Ratio icons with transparent backgrounds, for both the template itself and the services it includes.

### Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are important for readability and consistency; using proper names enhances the overall quality and credibility of your template.

Always follow the naming conventions for the software that the template is made for.

Example, if the template is for ClickHouse, the service and template name should be named `ClickHouse` with a capital C and H, since that is how the brand name is spelled.

For anything else, such as custom software, use capital case and avoid using special characters or dashes, space-delimited is the way to go.

### Environment Variables

Properly set up environment variables are a great way to increase the usability of your template.

When using environment variables:

- Always include a description of what the variable is for.

- For any secrets, passwords, keys, etc., use [template variable functions](/guides/create#template-variable-functions) to generate them.

- Use [reference variables](/guides/variables#referencing-another-services-variable) when possible.

- Include helpful pre-built variables that the user may need, such as database connection strings, API keys, ports, etc.

### Health Checks

Health checks are important for ensuring that the service is running properly, before traffic is routed to it.

Although a health check might not be needed for all software, such as Discord bots, when it is applicable, it is a good idea to include a health check.

A readiness probe is the best option; if that's not possible, then a liveness probe should be used.

### Overview

The overview is the first thing users will see when they click on the template, so it is important to make it count.

The overview should include the following:

- **H1: Deploy and Host [X] with Railway**

    What is X? Your description in roughly ~ 50 words.

- **H2: About Hosting [X]**

    Roughly 100 word description what's involved in hosting/deploying X

- **H2: Common Use Cases**

    In 3-5 bullets, what are the most common use cases for [X]?

- **H2: Dependencies for [X] Hosting**

    In bullet form, what other technologies are incorporated in using this template besides [X]?

- **H3: Deployment Dependencies**

    Include any external links relevant to the template.

- **H3: Implementation Details (Optional)**

    Include any code snippets or implementation details. This section is optional. Exclude if nothing to add.

- **H3: Why Deploy [X] on Railway?**

    Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

    By deploying [X] on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.
