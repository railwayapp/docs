| **Public Networking** | A Project is like an application stack, or a system of related components.  Everything needed by the components in the system are encapsulated in a Project, including environments and variable.                                                                                   |
| **Private Networking** | Services are components that make up the Project. Services can be anything from frontend web servers, backend APIs, message queues, databases, etc.  Services can be configured with [variables](/guides/use-variables), start and run commands, restart policies, [volume mounts](/guides/use-volumes), etc. |
| **TCP Proxy** | Variable management is an essential part of development operations.  Variables can be scoped to both Services and Environments in Railway.                                                                                                            |
