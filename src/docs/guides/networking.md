|-|-|
| **Public Networking** | Public networking refers to exposing your application to the public network.  Railway makes it easy to make your applications publicly accessible.                                                                                   |
| **Private Networking** | Private networking refers to restricting communication of your services to a private network, inaccessible to the public internet. All Projects in Railway are provisioned with their own private network. |
| **TCP Proxy** | TCP Proxy is a feature that enables proxying public traffic to a TCP service, like a Database.  This feature allows you to connect to your database services in Railway from anywhere on the internet.                                                                                                            |
