| **Public Networking**  | Public networking refers to exposing your application to the public network. Railway makes it easy to make your applications publicly accessible.                                                          |
| **Private Networking** | Private networking refers to restricting communication of your services to a private network, inaccessible to the public internet. All Projects in Railway are provisioned with their own private network. |
| **TCP Proxy**          | TCP Proxy is a feature that enables proxying public traffic to a TCP service, like a Database. This feature allows you to connect to your database services in Railway from anywhere on the internet.      |
|                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
