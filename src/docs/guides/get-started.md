The guides in this section introduce foundational concepts, not only to the Railway platform but to development operations in general.

As you make your way through the guides, you will learn about these core concepts and components -

| **Projects** | A Project is like an application stack, or a system of related components.  Everything needed by the components in the system are encapsulated in a Project, including environments and variable.                                                                                   |
| **Services** | Services are components that make up the Project. Services can be anything from frontend web servers, backend APIs, message queues, databases, etc.  Services can be configured with [variables](/guides/use-variables), start and run commands, restart policies, [volume mounts](/guides/use-volumes), etc. |
| **Variables** | Variable management is an essential part of development operations.  Variables can be scoped to both Services and Environments in Railway.                                                                                                            |
| **Environments** | Environments exist within a Project and are useful for maintaining separation between Production and Development environments.                                                                                                           |
| **CLI**          | The CLI is handy for local development, used for things like running services locally using variables stored in Railway, deploying local code repositories, etc.                                                                                                                    |
