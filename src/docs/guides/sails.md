title: Deploy a Sails App
description: Learn how to deploy a Sails app to Railway with this step-by-step guide. It covers quick setup, database integration, the Boring JavaScript stack, one-click deploys and other deployment strategies.

[Sails](https://sailsjs.com) is a MVC framework for Node.js. It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.

Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps.

## Create a Sails App

**Note:** If you already have a Sails app locally or on GitHub, you can skip this step and go straight to the [Deploy Sails App on Railway](#deploy-sails-app-on-railway).

To create a new Sails app, ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) installed on your machine.

Run the following command in your terminal to install Sails:

```bash
npm install sails -g
```

Next, run the command below to create a new Sails app

```bash
sails new workapp
```

Select `Web App` as the template for your new Sails app. Once the dependencies have been installed, `cd` into the `workapp` directory and run `sails lift` to start your app.

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:1337` to see your app.

Now, let's deploy to Railway!

## Deploy Sails App on Railway

Railway offers multiple ways to deploy your Sails app, depending on your setup and preference. Choose any of the following methods:

1. [One-click deploy from a template](#one-click-deploy-from-a-template).
2. [Using the CLI](#deploy-from-the-cli).
3. [From a GitHub repository](#deploy-from-a-github-repo).

## One-Click Deploy from a Template

If you’re looking for the fastest way to get started, the one-click deploy option is ideal. It sets up a Sails app along with a Postgres database and Redis.

Click the button below to begin:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template/t3sAEH)

After deploying, we recommend that you [eject from the template](/guides/deploy#eject-from-template-repository) to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account. This will give you full control over the source code and project.

## Deploy from the CLI

To deploy the Sails app using the Railway CLI, please follow the steps:

1. **Install the Railway CLI**:
    - <a href="/guides/cli#installing-the-cli" target="_blank">Install the CLI</a> and <a href="/guides/cli#authenticating-with-the-cli" target="_blank">authenticate it</a> using your Railway account.
2. **Initialize a Railway Project**:
    - Run the command below in your Sails app directory. 
        ```bash
        railway init
        ```
    - Follow the prompts to name your project.
    - After the project is created, click the provided link to view it in your browser.
3. **Modify Sails Config**:
    - Open up `config/env/production.js` file and make some changes:
        - Set `http.trustProxy` to `true` because our app will be behind a proxy.
        - Set `session.cookie.secure` to `true`
        - Add this function to the `socket` object just after the `onlyAllowOrigins` array:
            ```js
            beforeConnect: function(handshake, proceed) {
                // Send back `true` to allow the socket to connect.
                // (Or send back `false` to reject the attempt.)
                return proceed(undefined, false);
            },
            ```
       **Note:** We only added this because we don't need sockets now. If you do, skip this step and add your public app URL to the `onlyAllowOrigins` array. The function simply rejects socket connection attempts.
4. **Deploy the Application**:
    - Use the command below to deploy your app:
        ```bash
        railway up
        ```
    - This command will scan, compress and upload your app's files to Railway. You’ll see real-time deployment logs in your terminal.
 - **Note:** You'll come across an error about how the default `sails-disk` adapter and `connect.session()` MemoryStore  is not designed for use as a production database, don’t worry. We’ll fix this in the next step.
5. **Add PostgreSQL & Redis Database Services**:
    - Run `railway add`.
    - Select `PostgreSQL` by pressing space
    - Select `Redis` by also pressing space and hit **Enter** to add both database services to your project.
6. **Modify Sails Database Config**:
    - Open up `config/env/production.js` file and make some changes to let your app know what database to connect to and where to save sessions:
        - In the `datastores:` section,
            - Add `adapter: 'sails-postgresql'`,
            - Add `url: process.env.DATABASE_URL`
        - In the `session:` section, 
            - Add `adapter: '@sailshq/connect-redis'`,
            - Add `url: process.env.REDIS_URL`,
    - Run `npm install sails-postgresql --save` to add the new adapter to your app locally.
7. **Configure Environment Variables on Railway**:
    - Go to your app service <a href="/overview/the-basics#service-variables">**Variables**</a> section and add the following:
        - `DATABASE_URL`: Set the value to `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (this references the URL of your new Postgres database). Learn more about [referencing service variables](/guides/variables#referencing-another-services-variable). 
        - `REDIS_URL`: Set the value to  `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` (this references the URL of your new Redis Database)
    - Use the **Raw Editor** to add any other required environment variables in one go.
8. **Redeploy the Service**:
    - Click **Deploy** on the Railway dashboard to apply your changes.
9. **Upload Local Changes**:
    - Run `railway up` to upload all the changes we made locally and redeploy our service.
10. **Verify the Deployment**:
    - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the server is running successfully.
11. **Set Up a Public URL**:
    - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
    - Click [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.

        - If your Railway account isn’t linked to GitHub yet, you’ll be prompted to do so.
3. **Add Environment Variables**:
    - Click **Add Variables** and configure all the necessary environment variables for your app.
4. **Deploy the App**: 
    - Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.

5. **Add a Database Service**:
    - Right-click on the Railway project canvas or click the **Create** button.
    - Select **Database**.
    - Select **Add PostgreSQL** from the available databases.
        - This will create and deploy a new Postgres database service for your project.
6. **Add a Redis Database Service**:
    - Right-click on the Railway project canvas or click the **Create** button.
    - Select **Database**.
    - Select **Add Redis** from the available databases.
        - This will create and deploy a new Redis database service for your project.
7. **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - Go to your app service <a href="/overview/the-basics#service-variables">**Variables**</a> section and add the following:
        - `DATABASE_URL`: Set the value to `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (this references the URL of your new Postgres database). Learn more about [referencing service variables](/guides/variables#referencing-another-services-variable). 
        - `REDIS_URL`: Set the value to  `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` (this references the URL of your new Redis Database) 
    - Use the **Raw Editor** to add any other required environment variables in one go.
8. **Modify Sails Config**:
    - Follow [steps 3 & 5 mentioned in the CLI guide](#deploy-from-the-cli).
8. **Redeploy the Service**:
    - Click **Deploy** on the Railway dashboard to apply your changes.
9. **Verify the Deployment**:
    - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the server is running successfully.
10. **Set Up a Public URL**:
    - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
    - Click [Generate Domain](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.

This guide covers the main deployment options on Railway. Choose the approach that suits your setup, and start deploying your Sails apps effortlessly!
