Public Networking refers to exposing your application to the internet, to be accessible from the public network.

## Port Variable

An essential part of connecting your service to the internet, is properly handling the `PORT` variable.

The easiest way to get up and running is by using the Railway-provided port.

### Railway-provided port

As long as you have not defined a `PORT` variable, Railway will provide and expose one for you.

To have your application use the Railway-provided port, you should ensure it is listening on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`, where `PORT` is the Railway-provided environment variable.

**Examples**
```python
# python web server
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=os.getenv("PORT", default=5000))
```

```javascript
// node web server
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port: ${port}`);
});

```

### User-defined port

If you prefer to explicitly set a port, you *must* set the `PORT` variable in your service variables to the port on which your service is listening.

For information on how to configure variables, see the [Variables guide](/guides/variables).

## Railway-Provided Domain

Railway services don't obtain a domain automatically, but it is easy to set one up.

To assign a domain to your service, go to your service's settings, find the Networking -> Public Networking section, and choose `Generate Domain`.

#### Automated prompt

If Railway detects that a deployed service is listening correctly (as described above), you will see a prompt on the service tile in the canvas, and within the service panel.

Simply follow the prompts to generate a domain and your app will be exposed to the internet.

**Don't see the Generate Domain Button?**

If you have previously assigned a TCP Proxy to your service, you will not see the `Generate Domain` option.  You must remove the TCP Proxy (click the Trashcan icon), then you can add a domain.

## Custom Domains

Custom domains can be added to a Railway service and environment.

Here's how it works:

1. Navigate to the Settings tab of your desired service
2. Add a custom domain and type in the name (wildcard domains are supported)
3. Add the `CNAME` records to the DNS settings for your domain
4. Wait for Railway to verify your `CNAME` record

Note that changes to DNS settings may take up to 72 hours to propagate worldwide. 

Freenom is not allowed, and not supported.  

The [Hobby Plan](/reference/pricing#plans) is limited to 2 custom domains.

## Wildcard Domains

There are a few important things to know when using Wildcard Domains:

1. Ensure that the CNAME record for authorize.railwaydns.net is not proxied by your provider (eg: Cloudflare). This is required for the verification process to work.
2. Wildcards can be used for any subdomain level (eg: `*.yourdomain.com` or `*.subdomain.yourdomain.com`).
3. You cannot nest wildcards (eg: \*.\*.yourdomain.com).

In order to use Wildcard Domains, you must add two CNAME records, one for the wildcard domain, and one for the \_acme-challenge. The \_acme-challenge CNAME is required for Railway to issue the SSL Certificate for your domain.

**NOTE:** If you're using Cloudflare, it is important that the \_acme-challenge record has Cloudflare proxying disabled (no orange cloud).

## TCP Proxying

You can proxy TCP traffic to your service by creating a TCP proxy in the service settings. Enter the port that you want traffic proxied to, Railway will generate a domain and port for you to use. All traffic sent to `domain:port` will be proxied to your service. This is useful for services that don't support HTTP, such as databases.

Currently we use a random load balancing strategy for TCP traffic.


## Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates

Once a custom domain has been correctly configured, Railway will automatically
generate and apply a Let's Encrypt certificate. This means that any custom
domain on Railway will automatically be accessible
via `https://`.

### External SSL Certificates

We currently do not support external SSL certificates since we provision one for you.

## Provider Specific Instructions

If you have proxying enabled on Cloudflare (the orange cloud), you MUST set your
SSL/TLS settings to full or above.

If proxying is not enabled, Cloudflare will not associate the domain with your Railway project with the following error:

```
ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
```

Also note that if proxying is enabled, you can NOT use a domain deeper than a first level subdomain without Cloudflare's Advanced Certificate Manager. For example, anything falling under \*.yourdomain.com can be proxied through Cloudflare without issue, however if you have a custom domain under \*.subdomain.yourdomain.com, you MUST disable Cloudflare Proxying and set the CNAME record to DNS Only (the grey cloud), unless you have Cloudflare's Advanced Certificate Manager.

### Redirecting a Root Domain Workarounds

Some domain registrars don't fully support CNAME records. As a result - when you add an `@` record for a CNAME, the domain registrar will create an invalid `A` record.

Registrars that are known to not fully support CNAME records for the root domain include:

- Freenom
- GoDaddy
- Ionos
- Porkbun

**Workaround 1 - Cloudflare Proxy**

You may also configure Cloudflare proxying for your domain to redirect your domain.

After a custom domain is added to the Railway service follow [the instructions listed on Cloudflare's documentation to configure the proxy.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205893698-Configure-Cloudflare-and-Heroku-over-HTTPS)

**Workaround 2 - Changing your Domain's Nameservers**

You can also change your domain's nameservers to point to Cloudflare's nameservers. This will allow you to use a CNAME record for the root domain. Follow the instructions listed on Cloudflare's documentation to [change your nameservers.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/)
