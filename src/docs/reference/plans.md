## Starter -> Trial

We’re revamping the Trial experience for developers getting started with Railway. Beginning July 3, new sign-ups will receive $5 in nonrecurring credits towards usage. 

The current Starter plan will be sunset effective August 1, which means there will no longer be recurring $5 monthly credits for Starter plan users.

If you’re on Starter and verified, here’s what will happen on August 1, 2023:

- You will be eligible to upgrade to Hobby plan with the fee waived

If you’re on Starter and not verified, here’s what will happen on August 1, 2023:

- You will be downgraded to No Subscription

**Tier Offering**

- Max to 512 MB of RAM
- Shared vCPU capacity
- Up to 1 GB of Disk (Shared between plugins)
- $5 one-time grant of free credits towards usage
- Project deploys are stood down if credit limit
- Databases are turned off when usage is reached _(your data is not deleted)_
- Max 5 members per project
- Max 3 concurrent deploys per user
-- If another deploy is attempted, Railway will remove the oldest deploy. This is intended as an anti-spam measure. If you need more concurrent deploys, please upgrade.
- Max total 5 of Projects, 5 Services, and 5 databases per user

## Developer -> Hobby

We’re introducing a Hobby plan for developers to build and run personal projects. There will be a $5 monthly subscription fee which includes $5 of usage, with additional usage billed at Railway’s standard rates.

For a small set of active builders on the platform, Railway will waive the monthly subscription fee. 

The current Developer plan will be sunset effective August 1.

If you’re on Developer and verified, here’s what will happen on August 1, 2023:

- You will be automatically moved to the Hobby plan with the fee waived

If you’re on Developer and not verified, here’s what will happen on August 1, 2023:

- You will be downgraded to No Subscription
- You can manually opt-in to the paid Hobby plan

**Tier Offering**

- Max up to 8 GB of RAM
- Max up to 8 vCPU cores
- Max 100 GB of Disk (Soft cap)
- Max 5 members per project

The Hobby Plan is meant for serious hobbyist use-cases. We recommend you upgrade to the Pro plan for a commercial license to use Railway.

## Team -> Pro

The Team plan will now be known as the Pro plan. A Pro seat will still cost $20 / mo (plus usage). Over time we will start to gate advanced features into this plan, like Regions, Replicas, and a whole lot more to come.

If you’re running a Team or are a member of a Team on Railway, no action is required. Here’s what will happen on August 1, 2023:

- Your Team plan will be updated to Pro
- You will start incurring charges for network egress at $0.10 per GB, and you will be able to see the network egress usage on the Railway Dashboard

**Tier Offering**

- Default up to 32 GB RAM
- Default up to 32 vCPU cores
- Up to 2 TB of Disk

If you need more limits as your application scales, reach out to us within your direct support channel. We would be more than happy to bump up those limits on a case-by-case basis. Note: Companies who wish to use Railway for commercial use must be on the team plan.

## Verification
Verification is a fraud prevention measure designed to filter out spammy actors while financially incentivizing legitimate actors. 

Verification status depends on a number of factors, including the age and activity of your GitHub account.

If you have trouble getting verified (often because your GitHub account is not up to the verification standard), don’t fret! You are still able to use a credit card and purchase Railway plans.

## Network egress charges
From August 1 2023, we will start billing $0.10 / GB for any network egress on the platform. We will not charge for any ingress. 

We’re obligated to charge for network in order to disincentivize platform abuse. According to our calculations, this should be negligible for most workloads. 

However, if you are downloading copyrighted movies, prepare to pay!

This includes:
