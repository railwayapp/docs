Refunds are for new customers who no longer wish to use Railway after initially trying it out. Railway offers refunds at its sole discretion, in line with our [Terms of Service](https://railway.app/legal/terms).

## Requesting A Refund

You can request for a refund in [Account -> Billing](https://railway.app/account/billing) under **Billing History**:

If you do not see a refund button next to your invoice, you are ineligible for a refund. **This decision is final** and we are unable to issue refunds for invoices that have been deemed ineligible.

After a refund is issued,

- It may take up to 5~10 business days for the refund to be processed and reflected in your account
- Your subscription may be cancelled immediately by us
- Your services may be taken offline immediately

If you'd like to stop using Railway, please remove your projects and cancel your subscription immediately. See "[How do I view/manage/cancel my subscription?](/reference/pricing/faqs#how-do-i-viewmanagecancel-my-subscription)" for further information.

## FAQs

### Why was my refund request denied?

Refunds are issued at our sole discretion. If your refund request was denied, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

- Your invoice contains resource usage costs. We generally do not issue refunds for resource usage, as those were resources you have consumed (in a manner akin to how a utility company charges for electricity or water)

- You have received a refund from Railway in the past

- You have violated our [Fair Use Policy](https://railway.app/legal/fair-use) and/or [Terms of Service](https://railway.app/legal/terms)
