## FAQs

### What happens if my usage is less than the committed spend tier I am subscribed to?

We will add a line item to your invoice to make up for the difference and you will be billed the price of the committed spend tier you are on.
For example: If you're subscribed to the $2000 tier and your usage is $1400, we will add a $600 line item making your bill $2000.

### How do I cancel my committed spend tier subscription?

You can cancel your commitment by going to your workspace billing page. Note: You will immediately lose access to the features attached to the tier upon cancelation.
