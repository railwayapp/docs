## Scope of Permissions

There are three scopes for project members -

1. **Owner**: full administration of the project.

2. **Editor**: Can create deployments, change project settings and add Editor and Viewer members.

    **Note:** Editors can not do destructive actions such as deleting services or deleting the project itself.

3. **Viewer**: Read only access to the project. Viewers can not make deploys or see environment variables.

The Project Owner is charged for the project's usage.
