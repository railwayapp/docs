Deployments are attempts to build and deliver your [service](/reference/services).

All deployments will appear in the deployments view on your selected service.

## How it Works

Upon service creation, or when changes are detected in the service source, Railway will build the service and package it into a container.  (If the source is a Docker Image, the build step is skipped.)  Railway then starts the service using either the detected or configured [Start Command](/reference/build-and-start-commands).

This cycle represents a deployment in Railway.


## Deployment States

Deployments can be in any of the following states.

#### Initializing
Every Deployment in Railway begins as `Initializing` - once it has been accepted into our build queue, the status will change to `Building`.

#### Building
While a Deployment is `Building`, Railway will attempt to create a deployable Docker image containing your code and configuration (see [Builds](/guides/builds)).

#### Deploying
Once the build succeeds, Railway will attempt to deploy your image and the Deployment's status becomes `Deploying`. If a [healthcheck](/reference/healthchecks) is configured, Railway will wait for it to succeed before proceeding to the next step.

#### Failed
If an error occurs during the build or deploy process, the Deployment will stop and the status will become `Failed`.

#### Success
Once the Deployment is live and running, the status will change to `Success`. 

#### Crashed
A Deployment will remain in the `Success` state unless it [crashes](/guides/deployment-actions#restart-a-crashed-deployment), at which point it will become `Crashed`.

#### Removed
When a new Deployment is triggered, older deploys in a `Crashed` and `Success` state are eventually removed - first having their status updated to `Removing` before they are finally `Removed`. Deployments may also be removed manually.

## Singleton Deploys

By default, Railway maintains only one deploy per service.
