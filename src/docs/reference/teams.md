Teams are how organizations are represented within Railway. Teams can be created via the Pro or Enterprise plans.

For more information, visit our [documentation on pricing](/reference/pricing) or <a href="https://railway.com/pricing" target="_blank">railway.com/pricing</a>.

## Creating a Team

Organizations can create a team by heading to the <a href="https://railway.com/new/team" target="_blank">Create Team</a> page and entering the required information.

## Managing Teams

You can open your team's settings page to manage team members and see billing information by clicking the gear icon next to the name of your team on the dashboard.

## Inviting Members

Under the General tab of the settings page, you can invite members to access the project.

There are two scopes for Team members:

- Admin: Full administration of the Team and all Team projects
- Member: Access to all Team projects

## Transferring Projects

Transfer projects from another Team or Hobby workspace easily.  Detailed instructions can be found [here](/guides/projects#transferring-projects).

## Invoicing and Billing

Railway offers a consumption-based pricing model for your projects. You don't get charged for resources you don't use, instead, Railway charges by the minute for each vCPU and memory resource your service uses.

However, if you expect to use a consistent amount of resources for large companies, you can contact us for a quote and demo. Railway will work with you to find a solution that works for your needs. We are willing to offer Purchase Orders and concierge onboarding for large companies.

Reach out to us at [team@railway.com](mailto:team@railway.com) for more information.
