Teams are how organizations are represented within Railway. Teams with a valid credit card attached are subscribed to the Team plan. Projects within the Team plan get generous limits on service caps such as 32 GB of RAM and 32 vCPU cores.

Team plans cost $20 per seat plus get billed for any service usage within their projects, for more information see our [pricing page](https://railway.app/pricing). Team

## Creating a Team

Organizations can create a team by heading to the [Create Team](https://railway.app/new/team) page and entering the required information.

After the team creation, you will be prompted to enter the team's billing information.
