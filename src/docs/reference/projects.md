Projects are containers for environments and services in Railway.

If you are logged in, projects can be found on <a href="https://railway.app/dashboard" target="_blank">your project dashboard</a>.

The project canvas is the default view for a project. Within it, a user can manage services and environments or select a service to view its configuration.

## Project Resources

- 100 GB outbound network bandwidth
- Ability to deploy multiple [services](/reference/services)
- Unlimited inbound network bandwidth
- Unlimited database services

## Project Visibility

Projects are private by default and only accessible to members of the project.

Projects can be made public, to be shared in a read-only state with anyone on the internet.

Public visibility is helpful for educators who want to show students how their projects look before a user deploys their own.

- Viewers don't need a Railway account to see the project
- Environment variables are private from viewers
- Services and Deployment logs are public

Find instructions for updating your project's visibility [here](/guides/projects#updating-project-visibility).

## Project Transfers

Projects can be transferred to other users or to Teams, depending on subscription plan.

- Project transfers to other users are only allowed for users subscribed to the [Hobby Plan](/reference/pricing#plans) (both the initiator and recipient of the transfer).

- Project transfers to [Teams](/reference/teams) are only allowed for users who are members of an existing Team.  Teams are a feature of the [Pro Plan](/reference/pricing#plans).
