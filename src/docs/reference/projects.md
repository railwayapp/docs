The project canvas is the default view for a project. Within it, a user can manage services and environments or select a service to view its configuration.

## Project Resources

- 100 GB outbound network bandwidth
- Ability to deploy multiple [services](/reference/services)
- Unlimited inbound network bandwidth
- Unlimited database services

## Project Visibility

Projects are private by default and only accessible to members of the project.

Projects can be made public, to be shared in a read-only state with anyone on the internet.

Public visibility is helpful for educators who want to show students how their projects look before a user deploys their own.

- Viewers don't need a Railway account to see the project
- Environment variables are private from viewers
- Services and Deployment logs are public

Find instructions for updating your project's visibility [here](/guides/projects#updating-project-visibility).

## Project Transfers

Projects can be transferred between workspaces or to other users. Both the source and destination must have an active [Hobby or Pro plan](/reference/pricing#plans) subscription.

- To transfer a project to another workspace you're a member of, you must be an Admin of the project.
- To transfer a project to another user, they must have an active Hobby or Pro subscription.

Detailed instructions on how to transfer projects can be found [here](/guides/projects#transferring-projects).
