## Setting up a Project webhook

For information on how to setup webhooks, visit [this guide](/guides/webhooks).

## Deployment Status

When a deployment's status changes, Railway will send a notification via HTTP to the URL provided in the webhook configuration.

Deployment states can be found [here](/reference/deployments#deployment-states).

## Volume Usage Alerts

When a volume usage breaches certain thresholds, Railway will send a notification to pro customers via HTTP to the URL provided in the webhook configuration.

The thresholds that alert can be configured in the volume settings page.

## Muxers: Provider-specific Webhooks

Webhooks contain Muxers which will automatically transform the payload based on the webhook URL. Below are the currently supported Muxers:
- Discord
- Slack
