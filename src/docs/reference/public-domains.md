title: Public Domains
---

Railway can provide a public domain to any service that is listening for traffic.  You are also free to use your own custom domain.

## How it Works

Railway can detect a deployment is listening for traffic.  When detected, you will be asked if you would like to assign a domain to the service. Then you can simply follow the prompts to generate a domain and your app will be exposed to the internet.

## Support
