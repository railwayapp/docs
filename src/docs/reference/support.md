## Business Class

For teams and large companies who need dedicated support, we offer Business Class. It's support and success designed for those who need the full attention of Railway. Business Class support is a dedicated support channel with SLOs for your company.

Reach out to us at [team@railway.app](mailto:team@railway.app) for more information on how to sign up.

### Chat Bridges

For Business Class customers, we offer Direct Support over chat channels. This allows you to have a dedicated channel for your team to communicate with Railway.

- In Discord, you'll have access to a **#direct-support** channel, allowing you to create a temporary dedicated bridge (more info below)
- In Slack, we'll embed Railway Engineers into one of your workspace's channels
- If you'd like to set this up over other channels (e.g. Microsoft Teams), let us know

**Discord Chat Bridge**

- When you sign up for Business Class, you have access to a channel in Discord called **#direct-support**
- From within the **#direct-support** channel, you will click the `Join Channel` button to create a temporary bridge dedicated to you
- After _7 days of inactivity_, the dedicated bridge will disappear, but you can always create another one through the **#direct-support** channel

Reach out to us at [team@railway.app](mailto:team@railway.app) on setting up dedicated chat bridges.
