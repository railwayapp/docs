## Help Station

Railway conducts its support over our [Help Station](https://help.railway.app) platform.

It hosts our community of 500,000+ users and developers. It is where you can find answers to common questions, ask questions, and get in touch with the Railway team.

Please ensure that you've searched for your issue before creating a new thread, follow the guidelines in [How To Ask For Help](#how-to-ask-for-help), and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://help.railway.app/community-code-of-conduct).

### Priority Threads

For Pro plan users, threads created in the [Help Station](https://help.railway.app) are treated as **High Priority**. These threads are guaranteed a response from the Railway team within 3-5 business days (if community members are unable to help).

We pay special attention to threads created by Pro users and ensure that questions or concerns are resolved in a timely manner.

For teams and companies requiring SLOs and higher-priority support over chat, sign up for [Business Class](#business-class).

### Private Threads

You create a **Private Thread** on [Help Station](https://help.railway.app/support) if you need to share sensitive information, such as invoices or personal data. Private Threads are only visible to you and Railway employees.

Private Threads have a slower response time (5 business days) because only Railway employees can see them. We recommend you to only create a Private Thread if you need to share sensitive information.

We may make the thread public for community involvement if we determine that there is no sensitive information in your thread.

## Discord

We have a vibrant Discord community of over 20,000+ users and developers. You can find the Railway Discord at [https://discord.gg/railway](https://discord.gg/railway).

Please ask your questions in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/713503345364697088/1006629907067064482" target="_blank">✋ ｜ help</a> channel, and refrain from pinging anyone with the `Team` or `Conductor` roles.

## How To Ask For Help

When you reach out for help, it's important that you help us help you! Please include as much information as you can, including but not limited to:

- Description of the issue you're facing
- IDs (Project ID, Service Name/ID, Deployment ID, etc.)
- Railway environment of your service/deployment
- Error messages and descriptions

This covers the following components: incidents declared on <a href="https://status.railway.app/" target="_blank">status.railway.app</a> including and especially incidents with end-customer impact (e.g. inability to login to the Dashboard), customer workload-impacting issues due to high load requiring intervention from Railway (e.g. requiring additional resources beyond your current limits). |

This covers features offered by Railway, including but not limited to our Dashboard, CLI, and platform-level features such as Deployments, Environments, Private Networking, Volumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3        | **Integration work and general questions related to Railway**. This covers customer-related requests involving integrating Railway with other services (e.g. fronting your Railway workload with a DDoS protection service), leveraging tools to use Railway the way you like (e.g. IaC provisioning/Terraform), or questions about Railway features or its platform.                                                                          |
