Railway offers numerous tiers of support for our users.

## Support Tiers

We prioritize support requests based on the plan you're on and the urgency of your request.

### Trial & Hobby

Trial & Hobby plan users are only eligible for community support over [Help Station](#help-station) or [Discord](#discord). Railway may respond to community threads, but a response is not guaranteed.

### Pro & Business Class

Pro & [Business Class](#business-class) customers can select the urgency of their request when creating a new thread in [Help Station](#help-station) or [Slack](#slack).

| Level    | Description                                                                | Eligibility                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| Critical | Production outage or platform issues blocking your team from using Railway | [Business Class](#business-class) |

## Help Station

Railway primarily conducts its support over our [Help Station](https://help.railway.com) platform.

It hosts our community of 500,000+ users and developers. It is where you can find answers to common questions, ask questions, and get in touch with the Railway team.

Please ensure that you've searched for your issue before creating a new thread, follow the guidelines in [How To Ask For Help](#how-to-ask-for-help), and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://help.railway.com/community-code-of-conduct).

### Visibility

You can create a **Private Thread** on [Help Station](https://help.railway.com/support) if you need to share sensitive information, such as invoices or personal data. Private Threads are only visible to you and Railway employees.

Private Threads have a slower response time because only Railway employees can
see them. We recommend you to only create a Private Thread if you need to share
sensitive information.

We may make the thread public for community involvement if we determine that
there is no sensitive information in your thread.

## Discord

We have a vibrant Discord community of over 20,000+ users and developers. You can find the Railway Discord at [https://discord.gg/railway](https://discord.gg/railway).

Please ask your questions in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/713503345364697088/1006629907067064482" target="_blank">✋ ｜ help</a> channel, and refrain from pinging anyone with the `Team` or `Conductor` roles.

## Slack

Railway offers Slack channels to companies and prospective customers. Customers can raise issues, coordinate their migration over to Railway, and provide feedback within a Slack Connect channel.

All teams can create a Slack channel within the Team settings page:

Users in a Slack Connect channel can invite their team members using the Slack interface or by pressing the `Join Slack` button again to initiate new invites.

### Slack Account Linking

We highly recommend connecting your Slack account if you have a shared Slack Connect channel with us. Doing so allows us to get insight into issues affecting your workloads without having to ask for additional information.

To link your Slack account to your Railway account, navigate to your team's [settings page](https://railway.com/account) on Railway.

_Railway only asks for permissions to link your Slack account's ID and your Slack Workspace's ID. Our integration can only see messages within the shared Slack Connect channel_.

## How To Ask For Help

When you reach out for help, it's important that you help us help you! Please include as much information as you can, including but not limited to:

- Description of the issue you're facing
- IDs (Project ID, Service Name/ID, Deployment ID, etc.)
- Railway environment of your service/deployment
- Error messages and descriptions
- Logs (build and/or deploy)
- Link to GitHub repo/code or template you're using, if applicable

## Business Class

For teams and companies who need dedicated support, we offer Business Class.

Business Class is support and success designed for those who need the full attention of Railway. Business Class support is a dedicated support channel with SLOs for your company.

Reach out to us at [team@railway.com](mailto:team@railway.com) for more information on how to sign up.

### Business Class SLOs

We prioritize Business Class customers over all other support requests.

| Severity                             | Acknowledgement Time |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| P1 (Outages, Escalations)            | One hour - 24/7      |
| P2 (Bugs)                            | Same Business Day    |
| P3 (Integrations, General Questions) | Two Business Days    |

For Business Class customers with a shared Slack Connect channel with us, you have access to
"Critical" urgency level support requests:

preventing your team from using Railway.

| 3        | **Integration work and general questions related to Railway**. This covers customer-related requests involving integrating Railway with other services (e.g. fronting your Railway workload with a DDoS protection service), leveraging tools to use Railway the way you like (e.g. IaC provisioning/Terraform), or questions about Railway features or its platform.                                                                          |
