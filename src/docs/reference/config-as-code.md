title: Config as Code
---

Railway supports defining the configuration for a single deployment in a file
alongside your code. By default, we will look for a `railway.toml` or
`railway.json` file. 

Everything in the build and deploy sections of the service
settings can be specified in this configuration file.

## How does it work?

When a new deployment is triggered, Railway will look for any config files in your
code and combine these values with the settings from the dashboard. 

The resulting build and deploy config will be used **only for the current deployment**.


The settings in the dashboard will not be updated with the settings defined in
code.

Configuration defined in code will always override values from the
dashboard.

## Config Source Location

On the deployment details page, all the settings that a deployment went out with are shown. For settings that come from a configuration file, there is a little file icon. Hovering over the icon will show exactly what part of the file the values originated from.

### Specify the Builder

Set the builder for the deployment.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  }
}
```

Possible values are:
- `NIXPACKS`
- `DOCKERFILE`

Note: Railway will always build with a Dockerfile if it finds one. To build with nixpacks, you can remove or rename the Dockerfile.

Read more about Builds [here](/guides/builds).


### Watch Patterns

### Cron Schedule

  "deploy": {
    "cronSchedule": "*/15 * * * *"
  }
}
```

This field can be set to `null`.

### Setting Environment Overrides

Configuration can be overridden for a specific environment by nesting it in a
`environments.[name]` block.

When resolving the settings for a deployment, Railway will use this priority order:
1. Environment specific config in code
2. Base config in code
3. Service settings

The following example changes the start command just in the production
environment.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "environments": {
    "staging": {
      "deploy": {
        "startCommand": "npm run staging"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### PR Environment Overrides

Deployments for pull requests can be configured using a special `pr` environment. This configuration is applied only to deploys that belong to an ephemeral environment. When resolving the settings for a PR deployment, the following priority order is used:
1. Environment with the name of the ephemeral environment
2. Environment with the hardcoded name "pr"
3. Base environment of the pull request
4. Base config as code
5. Service settings

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "environments": {
    "pr": {
      "deploy": {
        "startCommand": "npm run pr"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring a Build provider with Nixpacks

To define a build provider ahead of time, create a `nixpacks.toml` file and configure it like so:
```toml
providers = ["...", "python"]
```
