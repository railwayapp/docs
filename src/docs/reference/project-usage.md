title: Project Usage
description: Learn how users can see the resource usage of their projects.
---

Users are billed monthly based on the project's per-minute usage. All services within a project's environments contribute to the resources billed. You can find [specific per-minute pricing here](/reference/pricing/plans#resource-usage-pricing).

Users can see the usage of a project under <a href="https://railway.com/workspace/usage" target="_blank">the Usage page</a> within the Workspace settings.

### Billing Period Usage

This section outlines the current usage within a billing period, as well as any discounts and credits the user has applied to their account.

In addition to the current usage, the user can see their estimated resource usage for the current billing period.

### Usage by Project

The chart shows the cumulative usage for the billing period. If you delete a project, Railway will still count the usage towards your total.

The Current and Estimated cost metrics show the current resource usage and the estimated usage by the end of the billing period.
