Users are billed monthly based on their project's per-minute usage.  All services within a project's environments contribute to the resources billed. The rates are as follows:
1. **RAM** → $0.000231 / GB / minute
2. **CPU** → $0.000463 / vCPU / minute

Users can see the usage of their projects under <a href="https://railway.com/account/usage" target="_blank">the usage page</a>.

### Billing Period Usage

This section outlines the current usage within a billing period, as well as any discounts and credits the user has applied to their account.

In addition to the current usage, the user can see their estimated resource usage for the current billing period.


### Usage by Project
The chart shows the cumulative usage for the billing period. If you delete a project, Railway will still count the usage towards your total.

The Current and Estimated cost metrics show the current resource usage and the estimated usage by the end of the billing period.
