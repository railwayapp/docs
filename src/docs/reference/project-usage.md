### Billing Period Usage

This section outlines the current usage within a billing period, as well as any discounts and credits the user has applied to their account.

In addition to the current usage, the user can see their estimated resource usage for the current billing period.

### Usage by Project

The chart shows the cumulative usage for the billing period. If you delete a project, Railway will still count the usage towards your total.

The Current and Estimated cost metrics show the current resource usage and the estimated usage by the end of the billing period.
