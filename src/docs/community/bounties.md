Bounties are a community program where you can earn money by answering questions in [Central Station](https://station.railway.com). When you help solve another user's problem, you get rewarded. You can use your earnings as Railway credits or withdraw them as cash via Stripe Connect.

## How Bounties Work

Bounties are questions from the community that have a cash reward attached. When your answer is accepted as the solution, the bounty amount is added to your Railway earnings. You can use this as Railway credits or withdraw as cash.

### The Bounty Lifecycle

1. **Question Posted:** A user asks a question in Central Station.
2. **Bounty Created:** Railway marks the question as bounty-eligible and it appears on the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties).
3. **Community Responds:** Anyone can reply with a helpful answer.
4. **Solution Accepted:** The original poster (or a moderator) marks a reply as the accepted solution. **If someone solves your problem, be a good community member and mark their reply as the solution!**
5. **Review & Payout:** Railway reviews the solution and processes the payout.

## Finding Bounties

All active bounties are listed on the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties). You can also opt-in to receive email notifications when new bounties are posted by flipping the "**Subscribe to bounties**" switch on the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties).

## When Questions Become Bounties

Railway reviews questions in Central Station and selects some to become bounties. When your question is selected:

- You'll receive an email notification letting you know your question was added to the Bounty Board.
- Your question becomes visible on the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties) where the community can help answer it.
- You don't need to do anything differently. Just wait for helpful answers and mark one as the solution when your problem is solved.

### Why Some Questions Are Selected

Not every question becomes a bounty. Railway looks for questions that are:

- **Clear and well-written:** Enough context is provided for someone to understand and help with the problem.
- **Relevant:** About Railway usage, deployment, configuration, or troubleshooting.
- **Answerable:** The question has a concrete answer or solution, not just open-ended discussion.

## Bounty Amounts

Bounty amounts vary depending on the question. The standard bounty is **$10 USD**, but some bounties may offer more for complex questions or high-priority topics.

You can see the bounty amount displayed on each question in the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties), as well as beneath the initial post when viewing an individual thread.

## Requesting a Bounty

You can submit your own question as a bounty request in Central Station. This is useful if you have a question you think would benefit from community input and you'd like to incentivize a quick, high-quality answer.

### How to Submit a Request

1. Go to the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties) and click to create a new bounty.
2. Enter a clear title and detailed description of your question.
3. Submit your request.

Your request creates a private thread visible only to you and the Railway team. You'll be redirected to this thread after submitting.

### What Happens Next

Railway reviews your request to determine if it's a good fit for the bounty program. During this review, the team considers whether the question is clear, relevant to Railway, and likely to benefit from community answers.

**If your request is approved:**

- Your question is made public and added to the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties).
- You'll receive an email notification confirming your question is now a bounty.
- The community can start answering, and you can mark the best answer as the solution.
- Railway funds 100% of the bounty reward. You don't pay anything.

**If your request is not approved:**

- Your thread remains private between you and Railway.
- It will be treated like any other private thread in Central Station.

### Tips for Getting Your Request Approved

To increase the chances of your bounty request being approved:

- **Be specific:** Clearly describe the problem you're trying to solve.
- **Provide context:** Include relevant details like error messages, configuration, or what you've already tried.
- **Keep it focused:** Ask one clear question rather than multiple questions in one request.
- **Make it relevant:** Questions about Railway deployment, configuration, or troubleshooting are most likely to be approved.

## Earning from Bounties

When your answer is accepted as the solution to a bounty question, you receive the bounty amount as earnings. Your bounty earnings appear on your workspace's [Earnings page](https://railway.com/workspace/earnings) alongside any template and referral earnings.

### Requirements for Payout

For a bounty to be awarded, the following must be true:

- **Your answer is marked as the solution:** The original poster, a Conductor, or a Railway team member must mark your reply as the accepted solution.
- **Your answer solves the problem:** Railway reviews accepted solutions before processing payouts to verify the answer is genuinely helpful.
- **You're not the person who asked the question:** You cannot win a bounty on your own question.

If an accepted solution doesn't actually solve the problem, Railway may reject it and reopen the bounty for others to answer.

### Workspace Selection

Bounty earnings are deposited to your workspace. If you have multiple workspaces, you can choose which one receives your earnings by clicking "Preferred Bounty Workspace" on the [Bounty Board](https://station.railway.com/bounties).

## Withdrawing Your Earnings

You can use your bounty earnings as Railway credits or withdraw them as cash.

### Using Earnings as Credits

Your earnings balance is available on the [Earnings page](https://railway.com/workspace/earnings) and can be applied toward your Railway usage.

### Cash Withdrawals

If you prefer to withdraw your earnings as cash:

1. Go to your workspace's [Earnings page](https://railway.com/workspace/earnings).
2. Set up your cash withdrawal account by connecting Stripe Connect.
3. Withdraw your available balance.

Once Stripe Connect is set up, you can withdraw earnings from bounties, templates, and referrals, all from the same page.

## Tips for Winning Bounties
