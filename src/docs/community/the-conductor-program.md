The Conductor Program brings together the amazing people who make Railway's community special. Conductors shepherd the experience for our 45K+ community members. They are the bridge between the Railway team and our thriving community.

This program aims to foster collaboration and help our Conductors grow.

## What Do Conductors Do?

Our Conductors spend time in Discord and the Central Station answering questions, sharing tips, and making sure everyone can use Railway successfully.

Here are a few key ways they contribute -

- Providing community support through [Discord](https://discord.gg/railway) and the [Central Station](https://station.railway.com/).

- Maintaining a healthy and welcoming community atmosphere while moderating our channels and templates.

- Contributing to Railway's open-source projects through improvements and new features.

- Creating a direct feedback loop between users and the Railway team.

Through these activities, Conductors ensure everyone can use Railway successfully while helping to build a collaborative and supportive community environment.

## Conductor Participation

We believe in fostering an active and supportive Conductor program that enables everyone to make meaningful contributions. To help keep our community vibrant, we conduct friendly quarterly check-ins with all Conductors.

As a Conductor, you'll contribute regularly in these key areas -

- Community Engagement

  - Being an active, welcoming presence in community channels.

  - Building connections with fellow community members.

  - Joining community conversations and sharing experiences.

  - Looking out for the community by making sure discussions stay positive and helpful.

- Support Activities

  - Helping others in [Discord](https://discord.gg/railway) and the [Central Station](https://station.railway.com/).

  - Showing consistent engagement by regularly contributing to meaningful solutions across all Railway platforms.

- Open Source Contributions

  - Contributing through either small improvements or substantial feature additions.

  - New features should address community-requested needs with demonstrated user demand.

  - Bug fixes should focus on issues affecting multiple users.

We understand that maintaining consistent participation across these areas requires dedication and time. As part of our commitment to supporting Conductors, we have quarterly check-ins to discuss your experience and ensure you have everything needed to succeed.

While we aim for regular engagement, we recognize that life circumstances and priorities can change. If participation becomes limited, we may need to transition members out of the program during our bi-annual review. However, our door always remains open – former Conductors are welcome to rejoin the program when their schedule better accommodates regular participation!
