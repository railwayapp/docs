## Migration Steps

In this guide, we will migrate a Go (Beego) app with a Postgres database from Render to Railway. 

Here’s the link to the app. A simple chat app that have the options of Long polling and Web socket — https://github.com/unicodeveloper/beego-WebIM 

### 1. Set Up a Railway Project

Navigate to [Railway's Project Creation Page](https://railway.com/new). 

Select the **Deploy from GitHub Repo** option and connect your repository. If your Railway account isn’t linked to GitHub yet, you’ll be prompted to do so.

### 2. Deploy the App

Railway automatically detects a `render.yaml` file in your repository and provisions the corresponding services, including databases, web (both public and private), crons, and workers.

If environment variables are defined in your `render.yaml`, Railway will import them automatically to the appropriate services. If they are not defined, you can manually migrate them by following these steps:

**On Render**:

1. Go to the **Environment Variables** page of your service.
2. Copy all the variables and their values.

**On Railway**:

1. Open the **Variables** section for the relevant service.
2. Switch to the **Raw Editor** and paste the copied environment variables.
3. Deploy the changes to apply the configuration.

Railway will deploy both the Go app as a service and the database, as shown in the image above. You can monitor the service building and deploying in the [Project Canvas](https://docs.railway.com/guides/projects#project-canvas).

### 3. Database Migration

Railway supports a variety of databases, including **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, and **Redis**, allowing you to deploy the one that best fits your application needs.

When a `render.yaml` file includes a `databases` section, Railway will automatically provision a **PostgreSQL database** for your app. If you're migrating data to Railway, you can follow these steps:

1. Export your database from Render using tools like `pg_dump`.
2. Import the data into Railway using `psql`.

For detailed instructions, check out [this comprehensive tutorial on migrating PostgreSQL data between services.](https://blog.railway.com/p/postgre-backup)

Once the migration is complete, update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Railway app to point to the new PostgreSQL database.

### 4. Multi-region deployments

If your app needs to use multi-region deployments, you can leverage Railway’s [multi-region replicas](https://docs.railway.com/reference/scaling#multi-region-replicas). 

Enable this in the **Settings** section of your Railway service to keep your app close to users worldwide.

**Note:** Multi-region replicas is currently available to Pro users.

And that’s it. That’s all you need to migrate your app from Render to Railway.
