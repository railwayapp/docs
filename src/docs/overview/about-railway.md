Railway is a deployment platform designed to streamline the software development life-cycle, starting with instant deployments and effortless scale, extending to CI/CD integrations and built-in observability.

## Deploying on Railway

Point Railway to your deployment source and let the platform handle the rest.

#### Flexible Deployment Sources
- **Code Repositories**: With or without Dockerfiles.  Railway will build an [OCI compliant image](https://opencontainers.org/) based on what you provide.
- **Docker Images**: Directly from Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry, Microsoft Container Registry, or Quay.io.  We support public and private image registries.

- **Configuration Tuning**: When you're ready, there are plenty of knobs and switches to optimize as needed.
