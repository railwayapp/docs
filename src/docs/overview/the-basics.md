title: The Basics
---

This document outlines the core concepts of Railway, providing foundational knowledge of the basic building blocks you'll work with in the platform.

## In a Nutshell

- **[Dashboard](#dashboard--projects)** - Main entrypoint for all projects under your account.
- **[Project](#project--project-canvas)** - A collection of services under the same network.
  - **[Project Settings](#project-settings)** - Contains all project-level settings.
- **[Service](#services)** - A target for a deployment source (e.g. Web Application).
  - **[Service Variables](#service-variables)** - A collection of configurations and secrets.
  - **[Service Metrics](#service-metrics)** - Rundown of metrics for a service.
  - **[Service Settings](#service-settings)** - Contains all service-level settings.
- **[Deployment](#deployments)** - Built and deliverable unit of a service.
- **[Volumes](#volumes)** - Persistent storage solution for services.
  - **[Volume Metrics](#volume-metrics)** - Rundown of metrics for volumes (e.g. disk usage over time).
  - **[Volume Settings](#volume-settings)** - Contains all volume-level settings.

## Dashboard / Projects

Your main entrypoint to Railway where all your [projects](/overview/the-basics#project--project-canvas) are shown in the order they where last opened.

Projects contain your [services](/overview/the-basics#services) and [environments](/reference/environments).

## Project / Project Canvas

A project represents a capsule for composing infrastructure in Railway.  You can think of a project as an application stack, a service group, or even a collection of service groups.

Services within a project are automatically joined to a [private network](/reference/private-networking) scoped to that project.

### Project Settings

This page contains all the project level settings.

width={1365} height={765} quality={100} />

Some of the most commonly used project settings are -

- [Transfer Project](/reference/teams#transferring-projects) - Transfer your project between workspaces.

- [Environments](/reference/environments) - Manage various settings regarding environments.

- [Members](reference/project-members) - Add or remove members to collaborate on your project.

- Danger - Remove individual [services](/overview/the-basics#services) or delete the entire project.

## Services

A Railway service is a deployment target for your deployment source. Deployment sources can be [code repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) or [Docker Images](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-an-image/). Once you create a service and choose a source, Railway will analyze the source, build a Docker image (if the source is a code repository), and deploy it to the service.

Out of the box, your service is deployed with a set of default configurations which can be overridden as needed.

### Service Variables

Service [Variables](/reference/variables) provide a powerful way to manage configuration and secrets across services in Railway.

You can configure variables scoped to services or to projects to be shared amongst all services in a project.

### Service Metrics

Service [Metrics](/reference/metrics) provide an essential overview of CPU, memory, and network usage for a given service.

### Service Settings

This tab contains all the service level settings.

alt="Screenshot of the service settings tab"
layout="responsive"
width={1365} height={765} quality={100} />

Some of the most commonly used service settings are -

- [Source](/reference/services#service-source) - Here you can configure the deployment source, which can be either a GitHub repository with a specific branch or an image with optional credentials.

- [Networking](/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) - Generate a Railway-provided domain or add your own custom one.

- Custom Build Command - Here you can configure a custom build command if you need to overwrite the default, only applicable with [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs) based builds.

- Custom Start Command - Here, you can configure a custom start command if you need to overwrite the default.

## Deployments

[Deployments](/reference/deployments) involve building and delivering your [Service](/overview/the-basics#services).

## Volumes

[Volumes](/reference/volumes) are a feature that allows services on Railway to [maintain persistent data](/guides/volumes).

### Volume Metrics

Volume Metrics show the amount of data stored in the volume and its maximum capacity.

### Volume Settings

This tab contains all the volume centric settings.

alt="Screenshot of the volume settings tab"
layout="responsive"
width={1365} height={826} quality={100} />

Some of the most commonly used volume settings are -

- Mount path - The absolute path where the volume will be mounted within the deployed service.

- Volume Size - Displays the current volume capacity and offers the option to expand it if your plan permits.

- Wipe Volume - This action wipes all data in the volume and then redeploys the connected service.
