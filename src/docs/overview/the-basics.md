title: The Basics
---

This document outlines the core concepts of Railway, providing foundational knowledge of the basic building blocks you'll work with in the platform.

## Projects

A project represents a capsule for composing infrastructure in Railway.  You can think of a project as an application stack, a service group, or even a collection of service groups.

Services within a project are automatically joined to a [private network](/reference/private-networking) scoped to that project.  That's right.

## Services

A Railway service is a deployment target for your deployment source.  Deployment sources can be code repositories or Docker Images.  Once you create a service and choose a source, Railway will analyze the source, build a Docker image (if the source is a code repository), and deploy it to the service.

Out of the box, your service is deployed with a set of default configurations which can be overridden as needed.

## Variables

Variables provide a powerful way to manage configuration and secrets across services in Railway.

You can configure variables scoped to services or to projects to be shared amongst all services in a project.
