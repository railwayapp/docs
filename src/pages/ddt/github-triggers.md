title: GitHub Triggers
---

Configure Railway to deploy every push to a repo by going to Deployments > Auto
Deploys in your project. Here you can select a GitHub repo and branch to deploy
from. If you have more than 1 [Railway environment](/environments), you can
select which environment to use.

It is possible to create multiple triggers. With this workflow you can connect to your repo and
- Deploy _master_ using the _production_ environment
- Deploy _staging_ using the _staging_ environment
