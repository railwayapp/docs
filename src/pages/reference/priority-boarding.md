Priority Boarding is Railway's beta program. The railway team are always working on pushing new beta features out to priority boarding. We also offer a Discord channel dedicated to this, allowing you to submit feedback. 

To read more about Priority Boarding, check out [Priority Boarding: The Journey to Get There](https://blog.railway.app/p/building-the-beta).

## Getting Started
Priority Boarding is available to users who have connected their Railway account to Discord. To get started, visit [General Settings](https://railway.app/account), scroll down to Account Settings, and connect your account to the Railway Discord server.

Once connected to Discord, you'll need to let Percy, the Railway Discord bot, know that you'd like to be a part of priority boarding. 

In Discord, open up any channel, enter `/beta`, and follow the prompts.

You should now have access to the `#priority-boarding` channel. You should also see that your Account Settings now display a new Priority Boarding status.

From this point forward, you'll have Priority Boarding features automatically enabled for your account. We'll notify you of any new features via the [Changelog](https://railway.app/changelog). We kindly request that you report any issues you encounter in the Discord channel.

That's all there is to it! Thanks for helping improve Railway, and we'll see you in Priority Boarding.
