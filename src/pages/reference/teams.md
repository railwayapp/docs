Teams are how organizations are represented within Railway. 

To provision a team, they must be used with an active usage based subscription.

Team plans cost $20 per seat, for more information see our [pricing page](https://railway.app/pricing).

## Creating a Team

Organizations can create a team by heading to the [Create Team](https://railway.app/new/team) page and entering in the required information.

After the team is created, you will be prompted to enter your billing information.

## Managing Teams

You can open your team's settings page to manage team members and see billing information by clicking the gear icon next to the name of your team on the dashboard.

## Inviting Members 

Under the General tab of the settings page, you can invite members to access the project.

There are two scopes for Team members
- Admin: full administration of the Team and all Team projects
- Member: access to all team projects

## Transferring Projects to Teams

In the Dashboard you can click and drag projects into the team. Just click and hold the handle icon on the project on the dashboard, you will see a drag interface appear and then you can let go of the mouse click in the desired team.
