title: Limits

Projects have limits on usage depending on the pricing tier the owner of a project is on. Projects that are made within a team belong to the team and aren't tied to a Railway user.

### Starter Plan Project Limits

Stater plans are designed to help you evaluate Railway and are fit for hobbyist projects. You get access to all features on Railway and you have no limits to the amount of projects you can provision. 

Starter plans get $5 of credits that do not accumulate. Starter plans also have an execution limit, users get 500 execution hours per month. Each service counts against the execution limit. If you have one service, it will deplete the 500 hour reserve at a normal rate. If you have two services, the timer will deplete twice as much.

**Limits**

- Limited to 512 MB of RAM
- Limited vCPU capacity
- Up to 1 GB of Disk (Shared between plugins)
- Limited to $5 of monthly usage
- Limited to 500 execution hours per month
- Project deploys are stood down if usage limit is reached
- Plugin connection strings are changed then hidden (your data is not deleted)
- Need to redeploy projects after the new monthly credit is applied to your account

### Developer Plan Project Limits

When you add a credit card or have a prepaid credit balance on your account, your account is upgraded to the Developer plan. The $5 of monthly credit no longer comes with an execution limit. You are billed for any usage above $5 on your account.

Developer plan projects have increased limits: limits are raised as projects approach them up to the hard cap listed here.

If a user unsubscribes or runs out of prepaid credits, the user returns to the Starter plan and the previous limits begin reapplying.

**Limits**

- Limited up to 8 GB of RAM
- Limited up to 8 vCPU cores
- Limited to 100 GB of Disk
- Limited to 5 members per project

The Developer Plan is meant for serious hobbyist use-cases or small commercial projects. We do urge companies to upgrade to the teams plan for the support required to maintain those workloads.

### Team Plan Project Limits

Team plan projects are designed to provide the most resources for all your scaled needs. Team project usage is charged in addition to the number of seats the team pays for.

Unlike the starter and developer projects, team members within a team can access all team projects.

**Limits**

- Default up to 32 GB RAM
- Default up to 32 vCPU cores
- Up to 2 TB of Disk

If you need more limits as your application scales, reach out to us within your direct support channel. We would be more than happy to bump up those limits on a case-by-case basis.

## Fair Use

If we deem that projects violate the [fair use](https://railway.app/legal/fair-use) policy, Railway will shut down any violating projects.
