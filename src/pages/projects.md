A Railway project contains all of your plugins, environments, and deployments. If you are logged in all of your projects can be found on [your project dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard).

All projects feature

- 100 GB outbound network bandwidth
- GitHub repo deployment triggers
- Unlimited inbound network bandwidth
- Unique copy of your infra for each PR
- Multiple custom domains with SSL
- Unlimited plugins per project

There are two types of projects.

## Temporary Projects

Projects that are not created by a user that is logged in are considered temporary. These projects

- Are destroyed **7 days** after they are created
- Are readable and writable by anyone
- Can be **claimed** by any user to convert it into a private project

## Private Projects

Projects that are created by a user that is logged in or that have been claimed are considered private. These projects

- Are only accessible to members of the project
- Are private and require permission to access

## Project Limits

Projects have limits on usage depending on the pricing tier the owner of a project is on.

### Starter Plan Project Limits
Stater plans are designed to help you evaluate Railway and are fit for hobbyist projects. You get access to all features on Railway and you have no limits to the amount of projects you can provision. 

Starter plans get $5 of credits that do not accumulate.

**Limits**

- Limited to 512 MB of RAM
- Limited vCPU capacity
- Up to 1 GB of Disk (Shared between plugins)
- Limited to $5 of monthly usage. 
- Projects become idle if usage limit is reached.
### Developer Plan Project Limits
When you add a credit card to your account, we increase the amount of usage credits on your account to $10 of usage. These credits do not accumulate. You are billed for any usage above $10 on your account.

Developer plan projects auto-scale: limits are raised as projects approach them up to the hard cap listed here.

**Limits**

- Limited to 32 GB of RAM
- Limited to 100 GB of Disk 

### Team Plan Project Limits

Team plan projects are designed to provide the most resources for all your scaled needs. Team project usage is charged in addition to the number of seats the team pays for. 

Unlike the starter and developer projects, team members within a team can access all team projects.

**Limits**


- Up to 240 GB RAM
- Up to 96 vCPU / container
- Up to 2 TB of Disk

## Project Usage

Projects on Railway are billed per minute and only for the resources projects use. 

**RAM**
$0.000231 / GB / minute

**CPU**
$0.000463 / vCPU / minute

Users can see the usage of their projects under [your billing page](https://railway.app/account/billing). 


## Fair Use

If we deem that projects violate the [fair use](https://railway.app/legal/fair-use) policy, Railway will shut down any violating projects.
