A Railway project contains all of your plugins, environments, and deployments. If you are logged in all of your projects can be found on [your project dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard).

There are two types of projects.

## Private Projects

Projects that are created by a user that is logged in or that have been claimed are considered private. These projects

- Are only accessible to members of the project
- Are private and require permission to access
