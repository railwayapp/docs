Under the Members tab, you can invite members to access the project.

There are three scopes for project members
- Owner: full administration of the project
- Editor: adminstration and can make deployments to the project, sans the ability to remove the Owner from the project
- Viewer: Read only access to the project. Viewers can not make deploys.

Only project owners are charged for project usage.

### Project Invite Links

Each project generates a project invite link. To invite someone via a link:
1. Select the desired invited member scope
2. Copy link and send to the invitee

### Transferring Projects

Users can transfer projects to other users. 

Under the members list in the members tab - click the 3 dots menu at the end of the user you'd like to transfer the project to.

The transferee receives an email with the current owner requesting to transfer the project to the user. Once that user accepts the transfer, they become the new owner of the project.
