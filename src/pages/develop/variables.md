title: Variables
---

Service variables are provided whenever you build, deploy, or run `railway run`.

Together these variables form your Railway environment. Each
plugin provides the necessary environment variables needed to use it (such as
`DATABASE_URL` for the PG plugin). You can also specify custom variables on the
project variables page.

You can view all variables for the current environment with `railway vars` and change the environment with `railway environment`.

## Bulk Import

Chances are you might already have a `.env` file laying around. You can import your existing environment variables via Bulk Import.

You can click the `Bulk Import` link to open up a modal where you can paste in a list of variables separated by new line.

### Automatic Detection of Environment Variables

If you initialize the a new project from the CLI- if a .env file is detected, Railway will now prompt to see if you'd like to import it into your new project.

## Multiline Variables

Railway supports multiline variables/object variables. Just type or paste in the value as you would normally.

## Railway Provided Variables

Railway provides the following additional system environment variables to all
builds and deployments.

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Templated Variables

Variables can reference other variables using the `${{ MY_VAR }}` templating
syntax. This can help reduce duplication if you need the same value in more than
one variable, or need to present a plugin-provided variable differently.

**Note:** The above `RAILWAY_*` variables aren't yet supported in templates

### Construct "Meta" Variables

If you find yourself needing the same value in more than one place, you can
create a template to avoid duplication. The following example constructs a URL
from an AWS S3 configuration:

```
S3_HOST    = us-west-2.amazonaws.com
S3_BUCKET  = mybucket
STATIC_URL = https://${{ S3_HOST }}/${{ S3_BUCKET }}/static/
```

### "Rename" Plugin Variables

Railway plugins provide a fixed set of variables. If your application requires a
variable to be under different name, create a new custom variable that uses a
template to reference the original:

```
DATABASE_URL = ${{ MYSQL_URL }}
```
