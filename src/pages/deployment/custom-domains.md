title: Custom Domains

Custom domains can be configures inside of the Deployment -> Domains tab.

Press edit, type in your domain, and we'll prompt you to update your CNAME.

            alt="Screenshot of Custom Domain"
            layout="responsive"
            width={2040} 
            height={1806}
            quality={100} />

Once the domain is set, head over to your favorite registrar and add the DNS record as directed.

**NOTE!:** Sometimes this takes a while due to DNS. CloudFlare is fast (seconds), Namecheap is slow (hours).

## Provider Specific Instructions

If you have proxying enabled on Cloudflare (the orange cloud), you MUST set your SSL/TLS settings to full or above. Otherwise, Cloudflare will not be able to connect to Railway.
