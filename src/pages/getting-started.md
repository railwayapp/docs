title: Getting Started

Railway is an infrastructure platform where you can provision infrastructure,
develop with that infrastructure locally, and then deploy to the cloud.

## Create a Project

Create a new Railway project by visiting [dev.new](https://dev.new) and
selecting what you want to do. Plugins can be added and removed at any time.
Once the project is created you will land on your project dashboard. This is
your _mission control_. Your projects infrastructure,
[environments](/environments), and [deployments](/deployment/up) are all
controlled from here.

## Install the CLI

The Railway CLI allows you to connect your code to your infrastructure. After
[installing it](/cli/installation), you can link your project to a directory
with

```bash
railway link [projectId]
```

The `projectId` is available on your project dashboard. If you were logged in to
the Railway dashboard when you created your project, you can run `railway login`
before init which will allow you to select from all your existing projects.

## Develop Locally

When developing locally, you can connect to your infrastructure by running your
code with

```bash
railway run <cmd>
```

We will inject all the environment variables inside your current Railway
[environment](/environments).

If you have a Dockerfile in your project directory, you can use `railway run`
with no arguments to build and run your Dockerfile.

## Deploy

To deploy your current directory, run

```bash
railway up
```

This will create a [deployment](/deployment/up) using the current project and
environment. Click the returned link to see the build and deploy logs.

You can also setup [auto deploys](/deployment/github-triggers) so that a deploy
is created everytime you push to a branch.

### Exposing Your Application

Before your application can say hello, Railway needs to know what PORT to listen on to expose your application to the internet. Railway does try to do it's best to do this automatically for you however there are cases when we can't.

You can configure your application to use the `PORT` environment variable. You can add the `PORT` variable under your project's variables. (Command + K and type `Variables` or you can use the keyboard shortcut: `G` + `V` under your selected project)

Keep in mind, when you publish your app, make sure that your application's IP is not set to `127.0.0.0`, Railway won't be able to expose your application if it's set to that IP.
