title: MySQL

The Railway MySQL plugin allows you to provision and connect to a
MySQL database with zero configuration.

## Connect

When you run `railway run` in a project with the MySQL plugin installed, we inject several environment variables.

- MYSQLHOST
- MYSQLPORT
- MYSQLUSER
- MYSQLPASSWORD
- MYSQLDATABASE
- MYSQL_URL

Many libraries will automatically look for the `MYSQL_URL` variable and use
it to connect to MySQL. You can also manually use these variables however you
like.


## Image

The MySQL plugin uses the [mysql:8]([mysql:8](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)) docker image.
