Projects on Railway are billed per minute and only for the resources projects use. All the services within a project in every environment contribute to the resources billed.

**RAM**
$0.000231 / GB / minute

**CPU**
$0.000463 / vCPU / minute

Users can see the usage of their projects under [your billing page](https://railway.app/account/billing).

### Billing Metrics

The chart for each project shows individual resource usage over the month. If you delete the project, Railway still counts the usage against your account metrics.

If you are on the developer plan it will show what your current bill will be at the end of the month.

On the starter plan, it will show the remaining usage balance you have.

### Billing Alerts

Throughout the month as your usage increases, we will send you an email reminding you how much usage you have used, and if you are on the Starter plan, how much usage you have remaining.
