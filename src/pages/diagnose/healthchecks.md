Healthchecks can be used to guarantee zero-downtime deployments of your service by ensuring the new version is live and able to handle requests.

First, make sure your webserver has an endpoint (e.g. `/health`) that will return a response with HTTP status code 200 when your application is live and ready. If your application needs to do some initialization on startup (running database migrations, populating cache, etc.), it's a good idea to return a non-200 status code from your endpoint until the initialization completes.

Under Service â†’ Settings, input your health endpoint. Railway will wait for this endpoint to serve a 200 status code before switching traffic to your new deployment.

The default timeout on healthchecks is 300 seconds - if your application fails to serve a 200 status code during this allotted time, the deploy will be marked as failed and removed. To increase the timeout, specify the `RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC` variable on your deployment.

Build Logs include detailed healthcheck failure logs.

We also maintain Deploy logs for failed deployments, allowing healthcheck debugging.
