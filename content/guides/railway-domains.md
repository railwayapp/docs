Search, purchase, and manage domains without leaving Railway. DNS is auto-configured, WHOIS privacy is included, and auto-renewal is on by default.

## Searching for Domains

Go to [railway.com/domains](https://railway.com/domains) or click **Buy a Domain** from a service's networking settings.

- Real-time search shows availability and pricing
- Describe what you're building to get AI-powered domain suggestions
- 250+ TLDs available — `.com`, `.io`, `.dev`, `.app`, `.ai`, `.co`, and more

## Purchasing a Domain

Select a domain, confirm the price, and purchase with your existing payment method.

- Domains are registered for 1 year (some TLDs like `.ai` require a 2-year minimum)
- WHOIS privacy enabled by default
- Auto-renewal enabled by default
- If purchased from a service, the domain is automatically attached and configured

## Managing Domains

View all purchased domains at [railway.com/workspace/domains](https://railway.com/workspace/domains).

- See expiry/renewal dates, attached services, and payment status
- Toggle auto-renewal (workspace admins)
- Connect a domain to a service or subdomain at any time

## DNS

DNS is fully managed by Railway — records are created and maintained automatically. No manual DNS configuration is needed for Railway-purchased domains.

If you need manual DNS control, purchase from an external registrar and use [custom domains](/networking/domains#custom-domains) instead.

## Billing

Domain subscriptions are separate from your workspace subscription.

- Priced at cost, rounded up to the nearest dollar
- First-year price may differ from the renewal price
- You'll be notified before an upcoming renewal
- Auto-renewal charges approximately 30 days before expiration
- If payment fails, retries up to 3 times before the domain expires
