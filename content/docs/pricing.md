Railway uses a transparent pricing model: you pay a base subscription fee plus the resources you actually consume.

## How it works

Railway's pricing has two components:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Subscription** | A flat monthly fee based on your plan tier |
| **Resource Usage** | Pay only for the CPU, memory, storage, and egress you actually use |

Your subscription fee goes toward your resource usage - if you're on the Hobby plan at $5/month and use $3 in resources, you just pay the $5 subscription. If you use $8 in resources, you pay $8 total.

## Plans at a glance

| Plan | Price | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Free** | $0/mo | Experimentation with $1 of free resources |
| **Hobby** | $5/mo | Personal projects and side hustles |
| **Pro** | $20/mo | Production apps and teams |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Compliance, SLAs, and dedicated support |

All paid plans include generous resource allowances, with the subscription fee counting toward your usage.

## Resource pricing

| Resource | Price |
| --- | --- |
| **RAM** | $10 / GB / month |
| **CPU** | $20 / vCPU / month |
| **Network Egress** | $0.05 / GB |
| **Volume Storage** | $0.15 / GB / month |

You're billed by the minute for compute resources, so you only pay for what you use.
