You can search, purchase, and manage domains without leaving Railway. DNS is auto-configured, WHOIS privacy is included, and auto-renewal is on by default.

## Search for a domain

Navigate to [railway.com/domains](https://railway.com/domains) or click **Buy a Domain** from a service's networking settings.

- Real-time search shows availability and pricing
- Describe what you're building to get AI-powered domain suggestions
- Over 250 TLDs available (`.com`, `.io`, `.dev`, `.app`, `.ai`, `.co`, and more)

## Purchase a domain

Select a domain, confirm the price, and purchase with your existing payment method.

- Domains are registered for one year (some TLDs like `.ai` require a two-year minimum)
- WHOIS privacy enabled by default
- Auto-renewal enabled by default
- Railway is listed as the registrant contact and handles all registry communications on your behalf
- When purchased from a service, the domain is automatically attached and configured

## Manage domains

View all purchased domains at [railway.com/workspace/domains](https://railway.com/workspace/domains).

- Expiry/renewal dates, attached services, and payment status
- Toggle auto-renewal (workspace admins)
- Connect a domain to a service or subdomain at any time

## DNS

Railway fully manages DNS for purchased domains. Records are created and maintained automatically, with no manual configuration required.

If you need manual DNS control, purchase from an external registrar and use [custom domains](/networking/domains/working-with-domains#custom-domains) instead.

## Billing

Domain subscriptions are separate from your workspace subscription.

- Priced at cost, rounded to dollar
- First-year price may differ from the renewal price
- You receive a notification before an upcoming renewal
- Auto-renewal charges approximately 30 days before expiration
- If payment fails, Railway retries up to three times before the domain expires
