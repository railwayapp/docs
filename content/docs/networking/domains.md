Railway provides multiple ways to connect domains to your services, from auto-generated subdomains to custom domains you already own, to purchasing and managing domains directly within Railway.

- [Working with Domains](/networking/domains/working-with-domains): Configure Railway-provided domains, custom domains, wildcard domains, SSL certificates, private domains, and DNS settings
- [Railway Domains](/networking/domains/railway-domains): Search, purchase, and manage domains directly in Railway with auto-configured DNS, WHOIS privacy, and auto-renewal
