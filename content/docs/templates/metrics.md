Once you publish a template, you can track its performance through the Metrics tab. Access it from your <a href="https://railway.com/workspace/templates" target="_blank">Workspace Templates page</a> by clicking Edit on any published template.

## Overview stats

The metrics dashboard shows key stats for your template:

- **Deployments**: Total number of times your template has been deployed
- **Earnings**: Total earnings from your template
- **Support Health**: Percentage of user questions you've answered in your [Template Queue](https://station.railway.com/my-template-queue), and whether you are eligible for the support commission bonus

## Extended metrics

*This section is under construction. Template metrics within Railway today are shown in aggregate, but we are planning to expand this view. In the meantime, please use the Gauge template documented below.*

To see time series on template volume and earnings, use the [Gauge Template Metrics](https://railway.com/deploy/gauge?referralCode=IFlm92) built by our community. Launch it within your workspace by following the instructions on the deploy page.
