title: Template Partners
description: Join Railway's partner program for template creators and technology owners.
---

Templates exist because of the community, but also because of the underlying technologies being in demand to deploy on Railway. Partners are owners of the technologies in the template marketplace.

With Railway's [Partner Program](https://railway.com/partners), partners can:
- Recommend optimal configurations for the technology in the template through verified templates
- Receive commission from templates using their technology
- Understand their OSS user base better through surfaced user questions
- Receive anonymous telemetry of how their technology is used on Railway
- Participate in co-marketing to Railway's large community

## Basic partners

Basic Partners are part of Railway's official [partner program](https://railway.com/partners) and receive the same kickback rate as creators. They verify templates to suggest optimal use of their technology on the template marketplace. Verified partner templates receive significant benefits:

- Featured placement in the template marketplace with verification badges
- Access to Railway's user base as a new acquisition channel
- Anonymous telemetry and aggregated user feedback on your templates

See all [verified templates here](https://railway.com/deploy?category=verified).

## Technology partners

Technology Partners receive all the benefits Basic Partners do, with a few additional benefits: 
- Commission on all templates using their technology on Railway (even if they didn't create them)
- A dedicated page for their technology on Railway, [like so](https://railway.com/deploy/cms/directus)
- More extensive co-marketing with Railway for additional visibility

### Technology partner commission

Technology partners get commission on all templates using their technology on Railway, even if they did not create them. This commission is in addition to the kickback the community template creator receives. 

Technology Partners receive the same kickback rates as template creators: 15% base, and if template questions are answered, up to 25% commission. This is for their effort in maintaining their technology. They are listed as a "maintainer" on the templates they receive commission on.
