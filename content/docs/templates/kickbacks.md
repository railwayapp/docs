title: Template Kickbacks
description: Earn revenue from your templates through Railway's kickback program.
---

If you publish a template, and it is deployed into other users' projects, you are eligible for a kickback of the usage cost incurred. You can receive kickback earnings in Railway Credits or with Cash Withdrawal.

Read more about the kickback program [here](https://railway.com/open-source-kickback).

## Eligibility requirements

To be eligible for template kickbacks, your template must meet the following requirements:

- **Marketplace**: Your template must be published to the [template marketplace](https://railway.com/templates). Private and unpublished templates are not eligible.
- **Terms of Service**: Your project must abide by Railway's [Fair Use Policy](https://railway.com/legal/fair-use) and [Terms of Service](https://railway.com/legal/terms). Templates that violate Railway's Terms of Service may be removed and kickback payments deemed ineligible.

## Kickback rates

- Templates receive a **15%** kickback of the usage costs incurred by users deploying your template.
- Support Bonus: Additional 10% (25% total) when actively supporting users via your [Template Queue](https://station.railway.com/my-template-queue)
- Open source templates receive 2x the rate (30% base, 50% with support)

## How earnings are calculated

Kickbacks are calculated based on the proportional resource usage cost of your template services. 

For example, if a user pays $20 in platform fees, then incurs $200 of usage from your template, you are eligible for up to a $100 kickback (50% of $200 for an open source template with active support).

**Minimum Payout:** The minimum kickback payout is $0.01. Any kickback amount below this threshold will not be processed.

## Supporting your template users

When users have questions about your template, they'll appear in your [Template Queue](https://station.railway.com/my-template-queue) in Central Station. You'll get an email when new questions come in, plus occasional reminders if questions are waiting. 

Answering these questions earns you the additional 10% support bonus and helps users deploy your template successfully.

Manage notification preferences in your [account settings](https://railway.com/account/notifications) under "Template Queue Emails".

## Open Source Partner Program

If you're the owner of a technology used in Railway templates, you can join the [Open Source & Technology Partners program](/templates/partners) to unlock extra perks like commission on templates using your technology, featured placement, and opens source product-management features.

## Earnings and withdrawals

By default, your template kickbacks are automatically converted into Railway Credits. But we also offer cash withdrawals. Visit the `/earnings` tab inside your account settings for more details. There you can add your details and request a withdrawal.

<Banner variant="warning">Cash withdrawals are **not** supported in countries like **Brazil, China, and Russia**. A full list of supported countries is available on the earnings page.</Banner>

### Withdrawal FAQ

#### How do I start earning cash?

Simply flip the switch on the Earnings page marked `Direct Deposit to Railway Credits`. This will stop auto-depositing your earnings into the Railway credits system. You will then begin accruing cash in your `Available Balance`.

#### How do I request a withdrawal?

Follow the instructions inside the `Earnings` tab. We use Stripe Connect to handle withdrawals. After completing the onboarding process, you will be able to request a withdrawal.

#### Why is my country not supported?

Due to local regulations and compliance requirements, certain regions are not eligible for cash withdrawals. You can choose from the 130+ countries that are supported in the onboarding process.

#### Can I make manual withdrawals to credits too?

Yes! Choose `to Credits` in the dropdown and then make your withdrawal request.

#### I have earned a lot of kickbacks from a template, but this page says my available balance is $0. Why?

The current kickback method is to automatically apply your kickbacks as Railway credits. You can opt out of this if you wish to start accruing cash.

#### Can I still use the older, automatic-credits setting?

Yes. This behavior is enabled by default. You can opt out of it, and back in to it, at any time. Simply use the switch on the Earnings page marked `Direct Deposit to Railway Credits`.

#### What is the minimum and maximum withdrawal amount?

For now, withdrawals may be made in $100 - $10,000 increments.

#### What is the timeframe from withdrawal request to payout?

Withdrawals are usually processed instantly. Once processed, the funds will usually take up to 10 business days to reach your account. Depending on your region and bank, this may take longer.

#### What if there are no questions for my template?

If there are no questions, you will receive the full 25% kickback for your template.
