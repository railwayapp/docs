title: Templates & Open Source
description: Everything you need to know about Railway templates and the open source partner program.
---

Templates provide a way to jumpstart a project by packaging a service or set of services into a reusable, distributable format.

As a Railway user, you can create and publish templates for others to use, or deploy templates from the [template marketplace](https://railway.com/templates).

Templates are the foundation of Railway's [Open Source Partner Program](/templates/partners). If you maintain an open source project, you can use templates to manage and monetize your technology on Railway.
